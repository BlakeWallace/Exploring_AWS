"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school.

Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better.

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

This is my husband. He is a Gulf War veteran. He worked 12 hours today as a mechanic (like he does every day). He came home, ate dinner, drank a beer, and helped me pack a few more boxes for our upcoming move out of this shitty apartment where we have lived for the last five years because housing is so freaking expensive where we live. (Obligatory fuck you to the greedy property management corps and Air BnBs who own goddamn everything around us). He is still wearing his dirty work uniform and is so tired that he hasn’t even showered yet because our work isn’t quite over for the day. He is taking a quick break to watch a few of the speeches before getting back to the task. He doesn’t complain though. No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion. My husband the veteran doesn’t want Traitor Trump to ever get near the White House again and he is so tired of the GOP and their negativity, fascist tendencies, and deeply skewed version of “patriotism.” My man is a hard working patriot and is voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

"For the first time in my life, I was drawn out to vote. 

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

Donald Trump is not fit to be the next president of the United States.",Democrats

I voted for the ticket with Harris on it in the primary, I'll vote for the ticket with Harris on it for the election. No problem seen.

I know that the 'no one voted for Harris' argument isn't legitimate, it's just the other side of the aisle trying to invent a wedge issue to break down Democratic support.

i **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him ""blow off steam""

"I have been seeing this very misguided idea floating around this sub, so I’ve decided to put it to rest by calculating the remaining vote and seeing how we can expect it to add up. I’m only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I’m not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I’ll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California — 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris’s favor):

Harris — 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon — 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris — 257,107 votes
Trump — 197,631 votes

Washington — 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris — 297,296 votes
Trump — 198,028 votes

Maryland — 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris — 333,894 votes
Trump — 201,877 votes

Arizona — 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris — 384,839 votes
Trump — 433,563 votes

Nevada — 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris — 63,416 votes
Trump — 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I’ll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris — 75,054,105 
Trump — 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don’t like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let’s be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November? 

IMHO I think the media is afraid Dems will win. I don’t believe corporate polls. What I see in my social network points to a blue landslide. If we only all keep working on the people we actually know IRL.",Democrats

My mom and I are kind of in a heated discussion about, of course, politics. She’s reposting things on Facebook that essentially accuse the Democratic Party of choosing our candidate for us and that it’s never been done in the history of the country, yada yada. It seems dangerously close to the “Kamala did a coup!!!!!!” argument I see a lot online.

My question is, how exactly does the Democratic Party (and the other one too, I suppose) choose a candidate? I’m not old enough to have voted in a lot of elections, just since 2016. But I don’t remember the people choosing Hilary, it seemed like most Dems I knew were gung-ho about Bernie and were disappointed when Hilary was chosen over him. I guess I was always under the impression that we don’t have a whole lot of say in who is chosen as candidate, and I’m just wondering how much of that is true and how much of it is naivety.

"Can someone send this memo to Jon Stewart?

I am so fucking sick of Stewart’s incessant bitching. I know Stewart and his fanboys fancy him the intellectual authority on all things but the “YOUR OLD! PEOPLE WANT TO BE INSPIRED!” take isn’t exactly cutting edge.

And didn’t we already try that in 2008? I seem to remember the change that followed the “inspiration” being too incremental and that resulted in a bunch of voters staying home in 2016 and landing us in this mess to begin with. 

Maybe an “intellectual” like Stewart should try educating his viewers instead of just riling up anger. Biden’s record is the most effective of a single term since LBJ. Even if you disagree with his agenda (and from what I can tell, his left leaning critics don’t disagree with his agenda, just his age), he has governed effectively.  But by all means

Look, if “I am voting to save small ‘d’ democracy so you can have the option to vote again in the future” doesn’t inspire you, I don’t know what will. 

Because clearly pulling our country back from the brink of economic collapse and a public health dumpster fire (that the last administration dumped fuel on top of) didn’t do it for you. Nor did ending our longest running war or masterfully handling every foreign policy crisis that has presented. Or his steps toward marijuana reform. Or his historic infrastructure package. Or the billions of forgiven student loans. Or record pace of judicial appointments that will hopefully undo some of the damage McConnell has done to the federal judiciary. 

Nor does that concept of giving the Presidency back to a convicted felon right after the Supreme Court has made a roadmap to using the Presidency to carry out self-interested illegality up to, and including, ORDERING THE ASSASSINATION OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS!

It’s funny that Stewart considers himself such a savvy critic on mainstream media, given that he is pushing their same nonsensical talking points. Looks like the dude bought into his own hype so much that he cannot even see he’s become the thing he devoted his career to criticizing. 

So, Mr. Stewart, to you I say — will you shut up, man?

"I’m deeply disappointed and troubled by the direction our country has taken with the re-election of Donald Trump, along with the strengthening of Republican majorities in Congress. This decision feels like a setback for so many of the values we cherish and protect. Trump’s previous administration was rife with mistakes and troubling actions—disregard for science, mishandling of the pandemic, divisive rhetoric, repeated challenges to the rule of law, and policies that harmed marginalized communities. These actions, to me, have been at odds with the leadership our country truly needs.

Giving Republicans control of both houses in Congress also threatens some of the most important aspects of our democracy and well-being. It’s likely we will see shifts in the Supreme Court with lasting effects on reproductive rights, which are fundamental to our autonomy. Support for Ukraine and America’s role in international stability may be questioned, leaving allies vulnerable. And policies that provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in our society—families struggling to make ends meet, communities fighting for access to healthcare, and children in need of safety and support—could face drastic cuts and neglect.

In the face of this moment, I can’t help but feel a deep need for reflection as a country. How did we arrive here, making decisions that seem to run so counter to the values of equity, compassion, and progress? There’s a real need to look inward, to have those difficult conversations, and to work toward an understanding of how we can move forward better and stronger.

And yet, my heart is heavy thinking about waking my daughter—again—for the second time in her young life to tell her that the glass ceiling of a woman president remains unbroken. For all the hope and progress that has marked her short life, this reminder of how far we still have to go feels especially painful.

I am also deeply concerned about the continued presence of election interference, both foreign and domestic. Misinformation, threats of retribution, and even false bomb threats targeting polling centers to discourage likely Democratic voters have cast a shadow over our democratic process. This isn’t simply about who wins or loses; it’s about the integrity of our elections and the faith we place in them to truly represent the voice of the people.

To those feeling hurt, confused, and scared—I am right there with you. This isn’t just a matter of disappointment; it’s a profound worry about the future of our country and the values we hold dear. I feel the weight of this decision on a personal level, as many of you likely do. It’s a time of uncertainty, and I know I’m not alone in feeling anxious about what lies ahead. I want you to know that every one of your concerns, fears, and frustrations is valid. We are in this together, sharing the same questions and the same hopes, even as we struggle to make sense of this moment.

As we look to the future, it’s more unpredictable than it’s been in a long time, and that unpredictability is unsettling. We are likely facing challenges that will push us all in ways we haven't imagined, yet despite everything, we must hold tight to the idea that this is not the end of our story. Democracy, though it may feel fragile right now, finds strength in the bonds that connect us—in the courage of communities that stand up for what’s right and in the compassion of people who look out for each other when times are tough. We are not powerless, and we are not without hope.

And there are reasons for hope. In this election, some incredible firsts remind us of the progress we are capable of. In Delaware, Sarah McBride has made history as the first openly trans member of Congress, a powerful step toward inclusion. Many states, including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and New York, have taken action to protect reproductive freedom in their constitutions, and Illinois has expanded access to IVF by requiring insurance coverage. Several states across the country have guaranteed sick leave and increased access to marijuana, while California, Colorado, and Hawaii have removed bans on same-sex marriage from their constitutions. These victories show that, even when national outcomes disappoint, there are still powerful moments of progress worth celebrating.

This might be a dark chapter, but our shared commitment to justice, equality, and progress is a powerful light. Together, with resilience and unity, we can still shape a future that reflects the best of who we are. While the immediate path may be hard to see, we can carry each other forward. Let’s not forget that we have the power to create change—and no election outcome can ever take that from us.

With hope, resilience, and a belief in the promise of our future,

"Not sure how much of a history geek you are, but I (late gen x) grew up learning about WW2 extensively. Primarily because of my grandfather - who served in the Navy, dodging kamikazes in the Pacific, surviving the Battle of Midway, and served his country admirably. I cannot imagine the horrors that man lived 24/7 during that war. He was 16 when the greatest conflict in human history broke out. Did he dodge the draft with a doctor’s note, citing ‘bone spurs’, like Captain Slapnuts?? No, he fought against an imperialist aggressor waging war. He wasn’t sympathetic to them, he didn’t side with them, and he sure as shit didn’t willingly vote them into office. But I digress.  

The result of this election is absolute horseshit. Seemingly fair and square, thus far. But still horse shit. Moving forward, as Democrats, we need resolve. We mustn’t give up our fight. Truth and righteousness **is on our side**.

Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister during the Second World War, gave a speech on June 4th, 1940. History will remember him as a racist, subscripting to superiority of the British empire, but as a young American learning about world history and that terrible war, I viewed him as a leader that Britain needed at the time. I see parallels in what Britain faced at the time and our situation now - but for us the Nazis have **actually landed on the goddamned beaches**. To quote Jeffrey Lebowski, *the other Jeffrey Lebowski*, “the plane has crashed into the mountain!!”

As we move forward as a party, we need the resolve the Brits had before and during that war. When faced with overwhelming hardships, they fought. When facing a determined enemy bend on their destruction, they were steadfast. When German bombers attempted to completely crush their will, they endured. 

Sorry for the long post, but I have a lot on my mind. Im sure most of you do also. I would like to present you with a small portion of that famous speech, lifted from the end of it, if you wish to seek it out and listen for yourself. Fight. Endure. Persist. 

> I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and **to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.** At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. *We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender*, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.",Democrats

 I am not only angry, I am absolutely furious with every single citizen who has betrayed America to the fullest by voting for Donald Trump because of so-called money! They say greed is good, it is not!

 Money and greed are the root of all evils! I was fighting for @kamalaharris because I wanted to fight for the people especially those with physical and mental needs who have not been heard!

"I recommend watching all of this but for the topic of what I’d like to discuss skip to 6:45.

After this election, there has to be a realization that politics are changing with the times. The DNC likes cookie cutter candidates and fear public backlash. Donald Trump has proven that a candidate can say and do WHATEVER they want and some Americans (70+ million to be exact) will still vote for him bc of promises to change the status quo. This status quo is what they view as causing all of their problems, whether or not it actually is. This is why we saw so many Bernie supporters flip to Trump. A large part of this country HATES the Dem establishment that still coddles billionaires and acts holier than thou. 

The working class of this country are PLEADING for change. Pleading for someone, like Bernie, to call out the corruption and change the system we live in and that cannot be disregarded any longer.   Its resulted in people believing Trump is either the answer or not a big enough threat to our entire way of life bc the status quo is that bad. 

If we wish to fight for social issues, we have to hear these people and accept their issues into our platform. Additionally, we have to recognize the importance of being a good spokesman for your message. In this video, Kyle suggests Jon Stewart as the next candidate which i tend to agree with. Of course, I’d love it to have the politician version of Stewart but we may be in a position politically where celebrity gives the party the best chance to win. Maybe “vibes” are just that important to swing voters. Another person mentioned by a friend of mine was Mark Ruban.

For Bernie supporters, this primary is very emotional. We want to avoid a GOP presidency and therefore support the candidate who, according to all available evidence, is more likely to attract the necessary independent voters to win. But more importantly than that, we see Bernie's candidacy as the best shot we've ever had to fundamentally reform our electoral system. Never before have we seen a candidate who is this grassroots. If Bernie doesn't win, we are scared that won't have another shot at this for a long, long time. My personal guess is 16-24 years (based on recent history). 

So, every time Hillary supporters take pot shots at Bernie or his supporters, every time they dismiss his transformative candidacy, every time they run up the score by trying to show us just how much the media believe Hillary will win, every time they openly celebrate a Hillary win without recognizing how emotional this is for is...well, simply put, they push us farther away. Get it through your heads: **we are sick of the establishment.** We are already disinclined to rally behind Hillary--stop making it even harder. That is, unless you want President Trump. ",Democrats

"This will probably be down voted or removed, but I wanted to do a short rant. I'm so sick of Bernie Sanders campaign nonsense. I am so sick of his dishonesty and lies. Hillary Clinton was damn right when she got pissed at that Greenpeace protester. Sanders is running a very disturbing and disgusting campaign, almost at the level of Donald Trump. I know for months I've been saying ""Bernie or Bust "" is stupid. But you know what, do what you want. I was watching Secular Talk, and Kyle said that that of you live in a swing state you have to suck it up and vote for Hillary or Bernie. But if you live in a democratic safe state, vote your heart. My heart won't let me vote for Sanders, so I never will, and that's okay because I live in New Mexico, a safe state.  So vote for heart and play politics well.

EDIT: Bernie Sanders supporters just a heads up you might be upset at the MSM today. If Cruz wins Wisconsin, and Bernie wins Wisconsin, the media will be dominated by Cruz his victory over. They won't even talk about Bernie Sanders. It will put a serious crimp in his momentum campaign. And if Wisconsin is closed like the polls are saying, Hillary Clinton still walks away with a healthy amount of delegates.",Democrats

"Bernie will defund the US military, in favor of entitlement programs, which is \*exactly what Russia wants\*.

He will further divide the left and right in our country, which is also, \*exactly what Russia wants\*.

Divide, and Conquer.

Anything that makes the USA weaker and creates infighting, they will support.

Why this is not registering, I have no idea. It seems there are millions of voters out there that have not made this connection.

Bernie fans, hate me for speaking the truth. My post is not meant to agitate. But I fear that with either candidate, Russia will increase its world dominance at our expense.

Polarization is bad for the country. Period. Both the far right and far left need to move closer to the middle for our country to be functional. That's the unfortunate reality as much as I agree with some of Bernie's ideas.

"I'm a nobody. Simple 'federal' employee making not enough. Married and desperately trying to start our family. I'm a die hard blue democrat too. Young, white male. Logic and reason is paramount to how I think. So take what I suggest with a grain of salt perhaps.

So. 

HOW TO WIN.


First things first tho, about Kamala. 

I'm sure she is a real-ass person, a lady and overall lovely human being. A fierce prosecutor. And firm AG. A brilliant senator. And a fine VP. Just not good enough to the masses. The media bobbled it totally, maybe on purpose. She got railroaded. He of course, they love to shine a turd, don't they???

Anyway.

It's all about selling a candidate to the audience, right? 

In this outrageous media and political climate, it's all imagery. The masses want someone in particular, they just don't know it yet.

The DNC needs an ace down in the farm system. LITERALLY.

They need to find a mid to late 30's or early 40's straight white male. He HAS to be a lawyer. A real good one too. Smart. Charismatic. Sharp as a tack. Good-looking. And a good dad and eagle scout husband. No bones in his closet.

And finally, he has to be a democrat thru and thru. Well, sorta. Maybe with moderate leanings to simple palatable policies. Immigration. Simple capitalist economics. Liberty and personal sovereignty. That type of shit. Easy to market.

He has to be from a small to medium-sized city. 150,000 to 370,000 population city. A bluish or purplish city. IN A RED STATE.

Not an activist. But a guy that cares for his clients. Taking up good causes and cases. 

You offer him the position. Hopefully he says yes. 

Then you POUR MONEY into campaigning his local 2026 house campaign.

Trump 2.0 backed by that dipshit Musk is gonna tear the economy apart. 100%

So you run him. This John Smith III.

He charms the dumb masses with his down home attitude. His laser sharp clarity reaches into their dumb little heads and grabs em! He simplifies the issues they are dealing with. And offers simple, reasonable solutions to the chaos. 

John Smith III wins his seat in the US House. 

As America grinds to a halt and panic world over ensues, you POUR MONEY into his media debut. Boost the ever-loving fuck out of him. Show him fighting for his constituents. Tearing apart the GOP and the idiocy of all their plans. He needs to be a political pitbull.

Then you capture the masses of morons that obviously inhabit our wonderful country. 

And you run him in 2028.

THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING WIN.

"So I want to illustrate why this cancelling of student debt proposal is not the greatest idea:

\- We offer a windfall to some-18% of the population....18%.  This is not a large portion of the population

\- We are offering this to roughly 44.7M people and/or a total of $1.7T in student debt.

Lets assume that the full 100% of the estimated student debt isn't relieved but just a majority.  So we are going to add ANOTHER $1.25T to our national debt to relieve 18% of the population?  And we think this will ""save"" a lot of people and stimulate the economy?  $1.25T is pretty much what our first infrastructure package was to help THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, this helps 18%.

This needs to start by addressing the problem first.  Student loan originators and the schools themselves need to be put into check first and foremost, I want to illustrate with a personal story I had the pleasure of going through with a close friend of mine.

I wanted to help a friend of mine deal with one of these student loan entities, Navient which is one of the larger ones.  Scenario was they had to go into bankruptcy for a completely unrelated reason to student loans back in 2012.  Once he came out of the bankruptcy this loan popped back up on his radar and it was actually a loan he took out for his daughters college schooling.  He shared all the info with me and it is unbelievable the liberties Navient took upon themselves during this time.  It actually stated on the invoice/bill to them directly under the ""Interest Rate"" line item that ""Interest rates on private loans are set by the lender"" so it was set to 11.75%.....are you goddamn fucking for real?  So you just get to set whatever fucking rate you want to?!  Man, I should go out and be a student loan broker....holy fucking shit.  So after I found this out I figured we would be able to call them and negotiate a lower principal buydown if we paid everything right now....as most collection agencies work.  NOPE!  No leniency, he needs to pay it in full either now or later....it doesn't matter we just need the full amount with all interest.

This is all part of the bigger problem.  Schools jack up their rates because they know any kid will get approved for an educational loan because, well fuck, the banks know ""we want the US to get more educated so we will approve anything and the federal loan process allows us to collect from them till the day they die so here, take $200K, we know we will get it back."".  It's a fucking self fulfilling prophecy that, for some reason, the feds back the banks making sure this albatross will be around their necks forever AND they can dictate what the interest rate will be?   

I get that I am illustrating the whole point some people believe why relieving student debt is a must but it's not the right way to do this.  Fix the systemic problem first otherwise it will continue down this path and help nobody.  People who were willing to take out a loan like this should still be responsible for the loan, they agreed to the more simple terms of knowing you were taking out a large amount money to pay for education.  If we want to look at rolling back the clock and putting a cap on the interest rate, that makes sense and I could get behind that but just throwing \~$1.25T at this problem seems frivolous.  I hear people on the very posts about canceling student debt talking about how they would, in turn, go buy a car and a house entering into another form of loan/debt.  If you were willing to enter into a student loan over your head to begin with I don't have a ton of faith those same people will go buy a house or car within their means and large defaults on loans absolutely does not stimulate the economy.  There just needs to be some sort of level of accountability from all levels; loanors, loanees and the educational instituation.

"I supported Bernie in 2016 wholeheartedly. I thought it was a mistake to support Hillary because the right (and Russia) had a big campaign against her that was working very well. I feel the same way this time around. I was in groups with a lot of older Dems telling them how dangerous it is to support Biden in the primary for the sole reason that so many young voters would turn their backs on the political process, not just in this year's election but for many elections to come. I was trying my hardest to make them see how harmful that could be. And now I'm in groups with mostly young voters, trying to make *them* see the dangers of sitting out in November. Of walking away from the party completely. I've been called many names and a lot of my posts have been taken down in all of these groups. And I can't help but think of Dr. Seuss' The Zax lol. I believe in Bernie, I believe in his policies and his vision. But I am definitely ""blue no matter who"" ~~with some limitations.~~

Why? Because I personally have a lot to lose with 4 more years of Trump. With quite possibly his third Supreme Court appointment. In his first two years in office I saw him chipping away at things that will impact **me.** And I know there are so many Americans that stand to lose way more! But everywhere I look, many Bernie supporters are not seeing that. They're not seeing the hard fought rights that can easily be stripped away. They're not thinking of the vulnerable people that will undoubtedly be hurt.

The virus has made it even clearer to me. So many people are talking about how this is a great time for workers to strike. Are they not understanding that so many people are losing their jobs right now? This will bring us into recession. Millions of people will be out of work, out of money, there's no way a mass strike could get off the ground with so many people desperate for work.

Dare I say the word guys, but it's a big neon sign flashing **privilege.** If I had a dollar for every straight, white, man that told me ""we have nothing to lose! #neverBiden"" I'd have enough money to justify voting red!

I want to start off saying I’m a moderate republican. If you want to discredit what I have to say on that basis alone then you can downvote and just leave. 

Second, I want to say Reddit is an echo chamber for left wing ideology. However, THATS OK! People with similar views and demographics tend to amalgamate. I am not hating on Reddit because it has a strong left bias. If anything, it’s healthy for people to discuss politics in an open online forum. 

What isn’t healthy is to completely disregard, hate, and repulse anybody with an opposite view to yours. I find myself here after seeing another “Dear ____ Supporters, Why?” On ask Reddit. At first glance it’s perfectly fine to ask people why they support a candidate you find unappealing. By hearing another sides argument you can build upon your own political beliefs or alter your beliefs with newfound information. 

(I want to acknowledge other posts that use different language, topics, and motives but I’m using the above as an example)

But these types of posts don’t attempt to do any of the above. Rather, it becomes a karma farm for those who provide nothing to the conversation. Almost all the highest rated comments are usually something along the lines “because I’m stupid”, “Because I hate America”, “Because I don’t understand politics lololol”, etc. 

Those who do provide real reasons for their support are downvoted into oblivion. Why would you ask for opinions you already don’t agree with, then downvote them because you disagree? It completely boggles and infuriates me beyond belief. Reddit has become as bad right-wing racist Facebook moms. 

As a final word, I’m tired of seeing comments in R/politics claiming that people on Reddit (only the ones they agree with btw) are the last citizens fighting for democracy and justice. Stop kidding yourself. Such debates and hissy fits have occurred over the same reasons, over the same types of people, over the same “bullshit political system”, over the past 300 fucking years. 

The only thing you achieve reading the same biased articles, the same biased comments, the same biased opinions, is you become just as partisan as racist Trump voters.

I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my ""enemy"". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.

"As I reminded myself this is the same media from 2001 that convinced their own people it was okay to bomb and completely destabilize the Middle East “because they had ISIS”, I decided to open my mind.

I attended BOTH rallies, Trump’s and Biden’s and needless to say, my mind was blown when I went to Trump’s. I never experienced such a magnitude of patriotism and unity. Numerous black people and other POCs were there, the majority of mainstream news would never show that. They looked happy and they were being treated equally from what I saw. People didn’t even treat them like black people, they were regular people like all other people. The primary message of the rally was to make our country better and the vibes were nothing but positive and energetic. In comparison, Biden’s rally was all about why Trump is a bad president and the energy was absolutely negative. People were angry and bitter, looking as if they were ready to beat up whoever expressed their support for Trump. This opened my eyes and made me realize where the hatred is truly coming from. As a longtime Democrat, I will be voting for Trump. We must start improving our country through unity, love, and positivity, which is completely opposite from what Democrats want at the moment.

Edit 1: clarification: what I mean by “People didn’t treat them like black people” is that they did not intentionally sympathize and treat them like victims just because they were black. They treated them like all other people regardless of the skin color. Sorry, English isn’t my first language and the wording could have been better.

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the awards! Never had an award before. :) This kind of outcome is not what I expected, let’s continue to stay united!

Edit 3: if you reported this post or feel the need to report, I strongly encourage you to open your mind and attend BOTH events instead of having all your thoughts formed by the mainstream news. Ability to keep your mind open and listen to both sides through unbiased lens is an extremely vital skill to have nowadays.

"Women on the left have been blasting this narrative that a Trump victory is a threat to women’s rights. The only “right” they’ve indicated being taken away is abortion, which clearly isn’t an issue that the president will even have to address. 

The whole message is that if you vote for Trump you don’t care about women. But as a woman who has a daughter I feel like I HAD to vote Trump to protect rights she has that are much bigger than abortion. Her right to free speech, her right to assemble, to protest, her right to exist as a female in exclusively female spaces like sports and restrooms, to bear arms, her right to a secure border and safe streets, her right to not have gender confusion or mutilation pushed onto her, her right to be educated and raised by her parents and not the government. Most importantly her right to be an innocent child.

"Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

im sitting over here in Europe (Italy) and I am just amazed how the media changed it's attitude towards the US in a matter of days!

The last 4 years they didnt write anything good about the US, about President Trump or about the Republican Party. And on inauguration day there were like hundrets of articles how good this is for the world, how Biden is the saviour of western civilization and that all Problems will be gone soon.

Where did investigative journalism go? The whole media apparatus is purely political nowdays. They dont care about the Hunter Biden story for example but as soon as Trump misspells a word they go craaazy.

The media is acting like a child who finally got their toy they wanted for so long.

"I’ve been quiet this election, not wanting to rock the boat. But since it’s Election Day. I’m gonna ask you - if you’re voting for a candidate who didn’t even have a primary election because you have a gay or transgender friend of family member, and you “care about their interests,” as a gay man diagnosed with gender dysphoria here are my interests:

-A secure border
- An end to funding wars 
-The protection of human life at all stages from from conception to natural death
- The protection of children from a billion dollar industry that wants to mutilate their bodies before they turn 18
- The protection of femboys and Tom boys who would grow up in any other age to just be gay or gender non conforming
- The right to 100% free speech - freedom of speech IS freedom from consequences from the government 
- The right to have the first female  president win because she is better than any man in power - not because she is a DEI
- The protection of women from men invading their spaces
- The protection from the state forcing a sh0t onto me
- The protection of my religion (Christianity) from an atheist death cult 
- The protection of illégal migrant children and innocent refugees (make them citizens, not slaves)
- The continued criminalization of mind altering drugs 
- The protection from sterilizing children who aren’t trusted to drink or vote or get a tattoo, but for some reason can destroy their bodies 
- The right to “just be gay” 
- The protection from erasure of the homosexual and lesbian communities by the alphabet mafia who seek to redefine what gay is 
- The protection from transgender people from military service 

Trump didn’t get rid of gay marriage back in 2016, when he had a Republican super majority. He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting. So if you’re voting today (which I beg you to do) because you “care about the interests” of your gay friends and family?

"I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? “National pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.” ― Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election.",Republicans

I thought the word “normal” had been cancelled by the woke left. I was publicly scorned 2 years ago for using the word  “normal” to describe someone who wasn’t suffering from a psychotic break.  

This person who publicly scorned me considers themself an oppressed minority. This person is a white female, attended an elite nyc private high school and Ivy League schools, inherited millions of dollars from their parents and identify as “they”. I can’t for the life of me figure out how they are oppressed.  Much like I can’t figure out who the hell is allowed to use the word “normal”.

The hypocrisy of the woke left. The self serving decisions. Those are the things that kill me a little bit inside.

I am not one to promote any particular commentator on here and I want you, my fellow Republicans, to determine for yourselves what is and is not important to us rather than the left telling us what is important, other countries telling us what is important, or any particular faction within the Republican party. I believe YOU decide what is important.

But there is one thing I think is crucially important that so many of us here (including myself at times) miss, and that is thinking about things more historically and more the way an artist might understand the flow of history. We need the nitty gritty, we need details, we need to look at the laws, the treaties, the minor incursions... we need to zoom into history with a microscope and view all those smaller (though serious and important) details.

But we also need to pull ourselves back and view history from a broader perspective. If you are a Christian who is familiar with Biblical history (and I encourage you all to be), one thing you will see is the ebb and flow of evil and good through time. When you see history this way, you can often see what is coming and be amazed as the details fill in towards that end. So very often this has brought the proper context to help me understand moments like the oval office meeting with Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy.

I think this particular episode of Andrew Klavan's show is so critically important because it contextualizes that event in a way that connects to history so easily, that you will understand the impact of it.

His argument (which I would go as far as to say is simply true) is that just like in WWII, we are in a world with a growing and serious existential threat. While Russia is undoubtedly bad, they have shown us historically that they are not the world domination type. Nor are we. We want to be sovereign to ourselves, and we are willing to compete, and we are willing to dominate markets and territories insofar as we need to to ensure we have the ability to be self sovereign in the face of threats like Russia and China. Russia is largely the same as us, they just do so in a messed up way as compared to us (obviously we are not perfect at this). China is not. China at this point in history wants domination of everything. They are self-sovereign, but they want more.

Russia always strikes me as Cain-like and we are more like Abel, and they are more Esau-like to our Jacob. In the Esau and Jacob story, Jacob is righteous (though imperfect) but Esau is just this kind of angry kid who loses his birthright. For time, the descendants of Esau dominate the descendants of Jacob, but that reverses.

Russia will not be a vassal to China or anyone else. Trump knows this; Putin knows this - that in the face of China, we will need each other. That does not make us friends, that does not make us respect each other. But when China moves, if the US is defeated, then Russia will be, too. If when China moves, if Russia is defeated, it may be that we are defeated, too.

There are other countries at play. I think India will play an important role. But right now, if you look at what is happening with this historical perspective and what happened in WWII, it seems Trump is trying to help cool the tensions between Russia and Ukraine because Ukraine either doesn't see or doesn't care about the threat that China is. China is a worse threat than Russia is to Ukraine and Zelenskyy doesn't seem to see that.

So to those who hate how Trump and Vance handled this meeting, please consider this. China is coming, they are poised. It is possible we can legislate and make moves that will keep them at bay, but right now they are preparing for war. Do you want to appease them like the UK did with Germany? Or do you want a leader who recognizes this threat and is trying to help everyone take some time to prepare but ending what amounts to a little spat compared to what we could see in a third world war?",Republicans

And why is America now so concerned with South African politics but on President Trumps campaign he has stated multiple times that America would no longer be involved in other countries politics and seems to be keeping his word except for his new vice presidents homeland.

"There was a recent Trump meme that many of you found distasteful while others saw it as him owning what the left calls him anyway. I don't particularly like the meme myself, but if they're going to call him a despot and if he is going to keep winning for us, then I don't see much of a problem with him owning that ""king"" title as a joke.

But that is not why I'm talking about this.

A user recently posted this meme in our sub. The user seems to likely be a troll who believes that Trump is literally involved in a billionaire coup to install a fascist government. This is a stupid take, it flies in the face of reality, though we should always be on the lookout for such things.

By the way, I was going to leave the meme up and just lock the thread, because looking through the user's history it was mostly benign, and then I found a comment that showed me who they were.

The user compared Trump to Smedley Butler who was involved in a planned coup of wealthy elites (including Prescott Bush - George H.W.'s Grandfather - this is true) to overthrow the government to install a fascist  government. Smedley would have been used to arrest the current government at the time (this was under FDR) and I believe he was supposed to be the dictator - What a name for a dictator, huh? He also railed against military involved overseas among other things. The comparison is quite faulty considering many things, like how so many billionaires are against Trump and for the Democrats. But the left, they hear ""billionaire"" and think evil immediately and then create conspiracies, and unfortunately there is some real history that acts as fodder for it. Look up ""Business Plot"". And while the history is likely distorted by the left, it is not untrue.

Anyway, the user posted that meme as a troll. I am disappointed to say that it worked.

While much of the thread was full of non-Americans, leftist, moderates who hate Trump, people who keep commenting in r/antiwork and r/democrats who will always come and start trouble, our own argued with each other with a vitriol that the left deserves, not our own.

There were two sides. Those who immediately trashed the president for this meme are the most noteworthy (but I'll get to the others). And by trashed, I mean those who completely decontextualized it, some with longer comments that were nicely written, and some that said little more than ""This is dangerous"". And this is coming from someone who is absolutely concerned about authoritarianism in any party.

There were also our own who sometimes feel like they are trolling with how ride-or-die they are for Trump. And this is coming from someone who fucking loves Trump right now, even looking past this meme and what I consider to be an error on his dealings with Ukraine recently.

Anyway, there was quite a bit of arguing between these two types of our own.

Now, the motive of trolls is not always simple. But regardless of their conscious goals, discord and fighting is the result. They either sow doubt in you as an individual or they encourage infighting with their tactics.

And what's worse is that they often use legitimate things that we *should* look at to do so. I don't know about you, but I would gladly talk about that meme rationally if a fellow Republican told me about it, but if some asshole troll throws it in my face, I'm not going to want to talk about it.

That is part of this, that is part of why trolls are such pieces of shit. We can have such conversations and should have such conversations, but on our own terms and when WE deem it a problem, because you know that they see many things as problems that are not.

**Be aware of these things**. This used to be known as subterfuge but now it is just normalized internet discourse. It's not okay. Temper your arguments, check suspicious activity, check your own use of logical fallacies (because these bad discourse habits are ingrained in most of us and we don't even think twice about it), and remain as civil as possible, especially when talking about hot button issues for us. The left is fractured now, they want us to fracture, too.

Lastly, it is a logical fallacy to disregard an argument based simply on the person who made it. That said, knowing who is making posts and comments and understanding their intent for bringing up their point is totally valid, especially when the user in question is just making a post and not necessarily commenting themselves, like in the case of the recent post. So when you see posts that piss you off, go ahead, look through the history of the user. I had to go pretty deep to find out about that user.

I will post a screen shot of the taken down post for your reference with the user's name blacked out (that is if I'm not too boomer-ish to do so... I still use old reddit pretty much all the time).",Republicans

"Hey guys genuine question here that I wasn’t allowed to post in r/askconservatives , probably due to their sub being spammed with Ukraine and Trump related questions and assumed I was a troll or something. Anyways I’m genuinely curious and want to know what my fellow Conservatives think. What’s the point of Trump negotiating a peace treaty in Ukraine if he doesn’t plan on America doing anything in any case? You would assume if America’s negotiating we’d be somewhat involved be it with sending troops to help administer a neutral zone or to guarantee Ukraine post-war but Trump has stated he does not intend for America do either or increase aid for Ukraine if the deal fails. If this is the case why even bother negotiating if we’re not going to get involved no matter the outcome? For the sake of being world-police? Also why should Ukraine accept any deal they view unfavorable now if they know the U.S. won’t support them even if they did sign the deal and why would Russia accept a deal if they know America won’t aid Ukraine anymore even if they don’t end the war? I just don’t see any point in Trump negotiating if America doesn’t have any involvement on the outcome, either just pull out and let them deal with it or actually have America involve itself in the outcome.

"I've been on board with cuts and investigation the Trump administration has been doing.. but I'm having a hard time understanding how this one is helpful. I'm heartily in favor of funding scientific research. This is limiting lab and equipment expenditures, a necessary part of that research. 

I'm not saying there aren't issues with the NIH that should be addressed. For one, there's loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public. Publicly funded research should be required to be published. But this isn't addressing that. 

If there's corruption, or conflict of interest issues, wouldn't requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution? And firing those that abuse it? Not this? 

If its that we don't want to waste money on pointless studies, wouldn't a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution?

The only other argument I've seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money. But do we know that, and if so, how? I've seen a couple of comments on YouTube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for. Not a very official source, I know -- where else can I look into that?

Does anyone have a good argument in favor of this?",Republicans
"We have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted. You'll have to excuse my boomerishness, but with New Reddit and some other changes (I still prefer Old Reddit) some of what we used to do has shifted. Some of these thing I think can be coded, but I am learning how. Again, forgive my ignorance.

Anyway, one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos, text posts, and image posts, if unchecked, were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us, but also intended to get us shut down. If some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we weren't diligent enough in taking them down, the sub could get shut down. 

That is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception, and it remained an unspoken rule. But things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made, and then new reddit happened and we mods just didn't adjust to the times perhaps? That's my excuse anyway.

People started posting links in text posts, which I thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it, but it was just a pain in the ass. They started posting text commentary under articles, which never used to happen.

So the issue is thus: too little oversight into posts leads to

* Shit posts (And I mean shit)
* Trolls having too easy a time to troll
* Bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users.

These new rules are to force commentary where it belongs, in the comment section. If you want to make a comment about your article, just make it in the comment section, don't change the title to comment on an article, and don't comment on the article in any body section (I think I changed that so you won't be able to).

**Forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the** ***same*** **commentary**. So do not complain about free speech on this front. Protestors have to follow rules, too, they are supposed to get permits, they are not allowed to just disrupt everything... at least anywhere other than blue cities.

This also prevents an annoying trend I've been seeing where users post a link to Google. Not a Google article. Not some app on Google to comment on the app in some relevant way, just posting a link to Google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post.

Hopefully I have removed that ability so the rule is moot.

We also hope to allow more things like text posts, video posts, and other posts. But that requires moderation. I can't tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll, brigade, and try to hurt us. An innocuous photo of Trump and the First Lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of Melania's dress or Trump's tie (I forget which). It was a troll post.

There may be setting changes to do some of this automatically (and I think there are, but I'm new to this part of moderating) so the rule doesn't even matter because it won't be possible to break these rules.

That said, I would also like you to know WHY we limit the kinds of posts we allow.",Republicans
"Summary:  View help for Summary We tested the fixity of political preferences of 136 healthy males during the 2011 U.S. presidential election season by administering synthetic testosterone or placebo to participants who had identified the strength of their political affiliation. Before the testosterone treatment, we found that weakly affiliated Democrats had 19% higher basal testosterone than those who identified strongly with the party (p=0.015). When weakly affiliated Democrats received additional testosterone, the strength of their party fell by 12% (p=.01) and they reported 45% warmer feelings towards Republican candidates for president (p < 0.001).  Our results demonstrate that testosterone induces a “red shift"" among weakly-affiliated Democrats.  This effect was associated with improved mood.  No effects were found of testosterone administration for strongly affiliated Democrats or strong or weak Republicans.  Our findings provide evidence that neuroactive hormones affect political preferences.",Republicans

END EDIT.

I covered leftist talking points in the last announcements (and I'll take that down once it seems the leftists, trolls, and bots have abated for the time being), but I wanted to discuss what it means to break our anti-Republican rule, along with our Reagan's 11th Commandment rule... because they are basically the same rule.

I'm going to go through some common complaints we get from banned users and how to avoid being banned like those users.

-**I was just stating a fact. What, FACTS aren't allowed anymore??**

Facts are allowed. They have always been allowed and even encouraged. But if your fact is laced with commentary, then it is not longer ""just a fact"". Here are some examples.

* **Fact**: The sky is blue.

* **What gets you banned**: The sky is blue, you fucking fascist.

Take note, because many do not notice the subtle difference between these two comments. Many who write something similar to the second comment will frequently in modmail say ""I was just stating a fact!"" This is so common, it's not funny.

Here's another one:

* **Fact**: Musk and Trump are uncovering a lot of fraud. While mistakes are being made, they are also being corrected, and Musk only has the power to report findings, not make final decisions.

* **What will get you banned**: Musk and Trump, man... these guys are running amok. I'm deeply concerned about how Musk is just firing people.

Do you see the difference? One is a fact, one is commentary and kind of half fact and half untruth. Many users do not see the difference. Be a user who does.

-**Just because I don't suck Trump's dick means I'm anti-Republican! I have been registered Republican for [X number of] years!**

This is one we get a lot. You must understand that we are a large umbrella. There are MAGA Republicans. There are Trump supporters who love Trump for this time in history but want to see leadership arise that is a bit more conventional as a leader and a bit easier for moderates to swallow. There are Republicans who absolutely hate the current president and the direction of the party.

We don't care what category you fall under. What we care about is that you show deference to fellow party members.

If you don't like the memes of Trump, fine, but don't trash people who do. And if you think it makes us look bad, I would just point out that the left has called us racists and bigots for literally decades and we took it in stride. They memed us in the media constantly before memes were even a thing.The character assassination attempts they did to Trump, they also did to Romney, to McCain, to Bush Jr., to Bush Sr., they accused Clarence Thomas of rape just like Kavanaugh. This is the left's M.O. and it has been for longer than I've been alive, arguably since before the Civil War.

You don't have to like the memes President Trump posts or that we on the right are making and posting. I don't particularly like them myself. But to trash fellow Republicans for it, without giving any understanding to the fact that the left have memed us and called us racists and bigots for decades, is disrespectful to your fellow Republicans.

You can argue it makes us look bad. But do so with respect.

* **What's acceptable**: I don't like this meme and doesn't think it helps our cause, but I can see why people find it funny and find it to be a valid answer to what the left has done to us for decades.

* **What's not acceptable**: The MAGA's who suck Trump's dick love this shit, but it makes us look bad.

*I would say to all the users who worry about looking bad to the left*: I know you care about looking bad to the left, but how about looking bad to your fellow party? Comments like the one just above make YOU look bad to ME and many of your fellow Republicans.

Show respect.

-**[Insert Prominent Republican's Name] is a piece of shit! He's a traitor to the party!**

I am a Christian first, a member of my family second, an American third, and a Republican lower on the list. I hope all of your have a similar hierarchy. Political parties are not the be-all and end-all. 

Political parties are tools to pool votes in a coalition to create a platform that a large number of people with many varying views can get behind and vote for in the face of another party that is doing the same with views we largely disagree with. They have value in the situations, but I kind of hate that they exist.

That said, being a sub FOR the party (although we are not affiliated with the GOP in any official capacity, we are just fellow Republicans), we do need to show deference to the party, we need to respect the party, we need to respect the umbrella, and we need to respect the individuals in the party.

I am not a fan of Romney but I respect that he is a Republican. So if I criticize him, I might have a little fun, but I won't just trash him. **Keep in mind, would you rather the left win, or have a [insert Republican you don't like]?** In my case, I'd rather have a Romney than an Obama.

* **What is acceptable**: Romney doesn't feel all that Republican to me these days and I really don't like how he keeps breaking from Republicans on so many issues, to the point I'd call him a RINO. But he's a strong business man and I'd take him over Obama any day.

* **What is not**: Fuck that loser Romney. He's a RINO piece of shit. I don't trust him.

Do you see the difference? One way criticizes while showing solidarity with the party, the other way is making it difficult to have any solidarity because it's so disrespectful.

We need solidarity. That does not mean we accept ""traitors"" if indeed we have any, but that does mean that we do not treat our fellow Republicans like crap. We don't throw them to the wolves unless it is clear we must. We don't cast them aside unless the allegations against them are credible. If they are indeed a RINO, show the receipts, but be respectful.

Matt Gaetz is a prime example. The right thing to do was to cut ties with him, but not before allegations were credible enough (especially knowing the left has made so many false accusations before). And also it should be done with the understanding that a lot of senators and congressman of all parties have likely been in a similar situation but just haven't been caught. He shouldn't have done what he seems to have done and it's inexcusable, but it also seems like a political targeting. Both of those things can be true at the same time.

We don't jump down a Republican's throat at the first accusation of impropriety, we let the facts come out and then deal with it appropriately. Getting hysterical about it from the first moment would lead to us not having Clarence Thomas or Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. We wouldn't have Trump. And think about how many it worked on. It worked on Romney, it worked on Bork (look him up), it worked on so many others. This is the left's MO. They tried to get rid of Hegseth because of a tattoo and baby clothes. Don't buy their hysterics, let the facts come out.

I hope this clears things up.",Republicans

"So for the first time in my life I voted early. Primarily so I don't need to take time off on election day, but also because this is the most consequential election since 1860.

I know that gets thrown around a lot. But it's seemingly true in every way.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**™** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

"For as long as I can really REMEMBER Republican Presidents (Reagan) ...the left has called them **Nazis.**

When Trump was elected, you said he was a *wanna be dictator.*  You said he was going to find a way to declare martial law and be President forever.  Some of you who say and said this were the same people who scoffed and (rightfully) laughed when some on the right claimed that Obama would do this.

So ... what have we seen in the USA since Trump was elected?  A constant invective of leftist pap from the commie boot-licking media.

Attempts to remove him from office.  Again and again.  

Claims that detention centers for illegal immigrants that have existed under numerous Presidents are now ""Nazi concentration camps.""

And see, we had a national emergency in Covid 19.  If he was going to declare martial law and overstep, that was the *perfect* opportunity to do it.  ""Why isn't he doing more,"" you said.  Because it is the right and responsibility of the state governors to deal with their respective states.  But he DID OFFER FEDERAL help to those who needed and requested it.

Covid did NOT make Trump into a tyrant.

So what came next?  Camera footage of the George Floyd arrest.

Most of America was horrified and agreed that the police bore responsibility for misuse of force ... (even though, apparently, that particular neck hold was accepted as a restraint method for someone resisting in a *number* of different states.)

We were fairly united in condemning that.

But then the left, BLM and Antifa took the opportunity to encourage and promote widespread destruction across the USA.  Destruction that didn't just ""burn property""...(though that in itself IS BAD) but took the lives of people and police and ruined businesses and created an environment that gave rise to a part of Washington state trying to declare itself to be a totally DIFFERENT autonomous country until they figured out that they couldn't do that (legally) and renamed themselves to a ""protest"" zone.  And people died there.

For days we watched as people tried to break down barriers around the White House.  The DC government appears to have abdicated their responsibility to keep the peace and seemed to stand down as 60 secret service agents were injured over the course of days of attacks against the White House and ***you thought it was funny*** that they might have been concerned enough at one point to put the President in the bunker.  You damned fools who think attacking the White House was good?  You have NO IDEA the defenses unconventional and otherwise that the White House has to debilitate your ass quickly.  These idiots legitimately thought that they were going to storm the White House and you acted like it was their right to do it because they were really mad about George Floyd.

**...a man who was killed in a Democrat run state in a democrat run city.**

We gathered what this was all about very quickly...and we watched ALL the livestreams of the protesting.  Yeah...we saw the one where the cop pulled a gun on a guy...and we ALSO KNOW that it happened because someone came up behind a police supervisor with a brick and smashed him over the head with it.

You ignored the destruction and riots in favor of a narrative of blaming the cops for reacting to SENSELESS riots.  Cops that were in mostly liberal cities run by Democrats.  Riot cops using riot techniques responded to riots and you did surprised Pikachu face.

It's been months now with this lawlessness happening and Trump has repeatedly told Democrat governments to get it under control.

But your Democrat governments failed you.  They decided that destruction of businesses sometimes created over the lifetime of black owners who cried in the streets after they were looted and burned...that lives lost..that packs roaming the streets bent on violence and anarchy... all of these were ACCEPTABLE...

...because it was making the President look bad.

He showed AMAZING restraint.  60 secret service members were injured and a church torched before Barr said that the perimeter around the White House should be moved back.

Months of violent protests.  Months.

And your Democrat leaders let you stew in it.  They abandoned their civilians and turned on their police.  You need to understand that they REFUSED to act appropriately and put many of you in real danger of harm because its an election year and these riots are ""bad for Trump.""

If it seemed like there was no one to protect you... it's because there was not...except the FEDERAL government and the governors kept telling Trump, ""Don't you dare.""  They refused to protect you and when Trump said, ""You need to restore order or I'm going to have to help your citizens..."" they said, ""Don't you dare.""

And he didn't dare.  He didn't declare martial law.  

He repeatedly asked the Democrat governments to stop the violence and protect the citizens.

And they didn't.  Because the destruction and bloodshed was acceptable because it made Trump look bad.  And the media carried their water.  There were not stories about how Democrat cities were failing to maintain law and order...there were stories about how these ""protests"" were justified.

...maybe they think it made Trump look weak... maybe they were trying to bait Trump into sending in help so that they could scream that he was a Nazi.

These protests are ""against fascism and police brutality"" you say!

***...So why the hell is the worst of it in Portland?***

Does Portland have a fascist government?  WTF are you even protesting there?  Portland is ""weird"".  Portland is antifa central.  You little shits harass innocent motorists there and the cops stand down.  Portland's NOT a fascist city.  But the trained Marxists of BLM and the violent anti-capitalist revolutionaries of antifa burned down the police union building, locked cops in a building and tried to burn it and are trying to burn a federal building.

**So now y'all got some federal attention.  And you've clutched your pearls to yell, ""Brownshirts!""**  

No... the BROWNSHIRTS are you little commie and otherwise criminal miscreants who have been making the streets unsafe across the USA for months.

MY GAWD...you called the Tea Party ""un-american terrorists""...but if they had pulled a QUARTER of the shit y'all have pulled...you would have had a POINT.

They pulled NONE OF IT.

**YOU ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS.**

You got naked women and alleged grandmas out there now for your human shield.  Are kids next?

And it's about time someone dealt with your FEDERAL crimes because your inept leftist leaders have put innocents in the way of violence over POLITICS.

Your cause is no longer just.

You need to stop doing violence.

Cowardly democrat leaders need to stop LETTING you get away with it.

Now the feds are in Portland.

**""They are unmarked brownshirts!""**

They ARE marked, but they don't look like your local officers, because they aren't. You have shown the kind of harm you mean to do to police who are identified.  You have already killed MARKED police officers.

When the unmarked mommy van pulls up and arrests you, I'm not thinking ""Fascism has come to America.""

I'm thinking, ""It's about FUCKING time.""

"First of all I want to say I am positing this here rather then /r/politics because I thik I more likely to get the discussion I want here then the obama zombie downvotes I would get there. Second I'm not going to start off saying weather or not I support gay marriage because I'm sick of people going ""I support gay marriage but..."" because they are afraid of the ridiculous reaction if they don't post that. You should be able to tell from what I'm writing.

First off, lets get one thing out of the way, Being gay has one big component and that is gay sex, if you don't have gay sex, you are just attracted to the same gender as yourself. I think a lot of people discount the ACT of gay sex in their discussions. It seems that it has been decreed as an ACTION that cannot be judged, which I find kind of ridiculous, but I will bring this point up again when I get to gay marriage.

Gay Kids are on the Front Line
I think the Gay Rights movement has put gay kids on the front line. Admittedly I think this would also happen without the gay rights movement, but I don't think the gay rights movement tries to shield gay kids, because it is not in their best political interest. There is a lot of emphasis put on coming out and being out and proud, and I think that is detrimental to some kids who just want to get through high school and move on to a community where they won't be treated like crap because they are the only ones who are different. I can see in some sense it may be a good idea to expose highschoolers to different sexualities early on for the sake of tolerance, but I think in most cases kids will be dicks until they mellow out around the age they get in to college. This is just a maturity thing. So in some cases there is no good reason for these ay kids to come out until college when there is a local community they can turn to. The counter point to this may be that kid who killed himself after his roommate tried to watch him having sex through a web cam. Perhaps if the room mate had been exposed to more gay people early on he wouldn't have done such a thing. Or he was just a dick who didn't like his room mate and would have tried to web cam him even if he brought a girl in to the room.

The Gay Hissy Fit
This is currently going on with Chick-Fil-A. When the country didn't overnight go ""Oh ok same sex marriage"" it seems a lot of people had really bad over the top reactions. Same Sex marriage is a HUGE social change. Marriage has mainly been between a man and a woman. Sure it has also mainly been a property transaction, a political move, a way to consolidate power, but even in those cases, it was between a man and a woman. (There is apparently some evidence of the very early church doing some kind of consecration of a same sex relationship, but it was more or less declaring the people to be brothers, not married) This isn't going to chance over night. There is nothing in the constitution about Same sex marriage because when you suggested to someone back then that two men might want to marry eachother, they would have looked at you funny. It was so obvious they they figured they didn't need to add anything about it. No, they didn't even figure. The over reactions to a differing opinion on the mater do not help the movement and in fact hurt it because it sets up a ""with us or against us"" situation. I think the issue of same sex marriage will be sorted out mainly with time, telling me I'm awful because I like Chick-Fil-A isn't going to help. The violent reactions to the people that supported Prop 8 probably just justified their donations in their eyes.

Same Sex Marriage
I just want to try and spell out what I think the problem people have with same sex marriage. The biblical passage basically point out that the ACT of gay sex is wrong. So people who believe it find gay sex to be immoral. Basically if you don't think gay sex is immoral you should have no problem with same sex marriage, plain and simple. However if you do find it immoral, you are going to have an issue with an official recognition of a relationship where that action occurs because it is forcing something on you, from your perspective. This is the only example I could think up that works I think. So some people like Dominant submissive sexual situations, maybe they take it so far that s that s lives as a slave with D. In their home s is D's slave. D and s decide that they want the world to treat them how they act inside their home, so they go to court and say they want a slave marriage where s is officially declared the slave of D, and s is officially property. A judge finally goes, well you are two consenting adults, and if s really wants it I will declare that s if officially property that belongs to D. So now everybody has to treat s as property, if s works a job his/her wages have to go in to Ds account because s is property and can't have a bank account, if s is seen driving around without D, the police have to bring s back to Ds house and so on and so forth. Some people might find that they don't want to do this because they think treating people as property as wrong and don't want the courts to tell them ""too bad, this is what they want"" so they then go ahead and try to make Slave marriage illegal. I'm pretty sure it breaks down because the Constitution expressly forbids slavery, but you get the idea. I think there is a lot of dicussion that doesn't happen because the gay rights movement just labels people as bigots and full of hate and that just hardens their hearts against gay rights and gay families. I don't have a solution for what they should be doing, but I don't certain things are working.

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

The problem is you're bringing that same behavior with you.  When you abuse the arrows by upvoting leftist comments and downvoting mainstream Republican comments then you're only going to recreate a smaller version of /r/politics.  You're burying the very differing viewpoints you were seeking.

Therefore, until the top comments in every thread are mainstream Republican comments we will continue to ban anyone pushing a leftist narrative.  

Are you a Republican who has liberal viewpoints on one or two issues?  I suggest you focus on the other issues for the time being.

"Liberal here. I’m looking for a civil and respectful discussion without the insults and name calling.

There’s been many instances where I’ve seen people, presumably conservative/MAGA/republican, comment on posts that Biden has screwed up the country or how badly he has done. However, they never elaborate on what they think was so bad. 

From my perspective I think he did a good job overall. As with every president I’d say he handled some things were very well and some were very disappointing, but overall he was good. Just real quickly the very good things, in my opinion, were his economic recovery after COVID, curbing inflation, handling Ukraine, infvesting in infrastructure, and green initiatives. Very bad was the Afghanistan exit strategy and an overly aggressive strategy to move towards electric vehicles. 

I find Israel and Gaza/Hamas very complicated and I honestly can’t speak with confidence about either side, but I do feel Israel had/has the right to defend themselves. Meanwhile a lot of innocent Palestinian civilians and children suffered needlessly.

So what did Biden do that was so horrible?",Republicans
"**TL; DR**: I'm certain these musicians and journalists are being dishonest (or ignorant) when they are saying Trump did not have permission to use their songs. Below is a bit about how the industry works and the reasons why, but the easiest way to think about it is like this: Does Dua Lipa know you signed up for Spotify? No. She agreed to let Spotify stream her music to you when you signed up so long as Spotify pays her based on the rate she agreed to with Spotify. Dua Lipa gave permission to stream her music to anyone who signed up for Spotify. It is the same model for political rallies. Foo Fighters gave authority to a licensing group like ASCAP to license their music for them. If you went through ASCAP (which Foo fighters is on) and you got a license, Foo Fighters already gave their permission to use their songs. You don't need to get individual permission if you get a blanket license.

**Alright folks, here's the detailed version:**

Music is frequently used illegally, so it is technically possible Trump didn't have permission to use various songs, but it is so unlikely that a major campaign would have not gone through the proper channels when using copyrighted material like a Foo Fighters song, because getting sued, losing money, and being tied up in court hurts the campaign. It's easier just to go through the legal channels.

Why? The music business is complicated.

The Foo Fighters (and any musician) can have many many revenue streams.

**Direct Sales** (Or mostly direct) - These are concerts, merchandise, and direct physical copies of their music (cds, records, cassettes, etc.). We buy a ticket and Foo Fighters get the money. Or really we buy a ticket from Ticket Master or a venue, the venue takes a cut and gives the rest to Foo Fighters. 

**Indirect Sales - Licensing** - *Music Licensing* is just the legal permission given from the artist to whomever wants to play the song for whatever reason. This is *incredibly complicated*, there are so many indirect ways Foo Fighters license their songs, but it is important to know that these ""non-for-profit"" groups [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/music-users), BMI, and SESAC basically track it all. If you are buying a license to play music almost anywhere, it is through these groups. If you are a musician, even a small one, and you are on Spotify, one of these groups is helping you track your sales.

Foo Fighters is on ASCAP.

Think playing music at a bar is simple? No. Representatives from ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC will absolutely find you (especially these days, it was harder for them to find you before the internet) and they will ask about music in your bar to make sure artists are getting what they are owed. 

**Indirect Sales - Blanket Licensing**

When these groups contact your bar, they will offer you a **blanket license** (probably not the technical term). If you sign up with ASCAP, it's kind of like signing up with Spotify. You have access to play any of the songs that ASCAP has in their repertory. If you have an agreement with ASCAP, then you can play Foo Fighters at your bar.

Alright, want karaoke at your bar? If a drunk guy wants to sing My Hero, well you better have a license so Foo Fighters get their cut through ASCAP (today, most Karaoke system bars use include licensing agreements already).

Want a live band? If they cover a Foo Fighters song, ASCAP will want to know and will start a legal suit against you for stealing Foo Fighters' music.

""Screw it, I'll just play the radio!"" - Nope, you need a license for that, too.

This is not unfair. If you own a song, you should have control where it is played and be paid appropriately. You can't use my song at a bar without paying me. That said, the system in place is pretty screwy.

It's also not has difficult as it sounds, but you do need to be careful. Bars have to think about music licensing (as well as sports licensing, tv licensing, radio, etc.) and build that into their business model. Maybe all they want is a Musak subscription, that includes all appropriate licensing already.

But this is true in doctors offices (technically if they play the radio in the waiting room, they are probably breaking the law), malls, concert venues (the music they play between acts), sports events, etc. 

**A key point here though is Foo Fighters have no idea WHO pays for these licenses and agree to the license whenever someone signs up through ASCAP**...I mean they could know if they wanted, it's all tracked, but Foo Fighters is really letting ASCAP do all that for them. Then the sales are all numbered, and royalties are usually distributed first to the Foo Fighters' label if they have one (the label gets a cut), and then to The Foo Fighters themselves.

So really, you might sign with ASCAP at your bar, you have access to play anything they represent and a portion of your recurring fee goes to all the artists whose songs you played at your bar.

*It should be noted that if Foo Fighters really hated some individual bar, they could legally go to ASCAP and say ""If you give this bar a license, we don't want our music played there"" and ASCAP will take you off their list for that individual bar the next time the bar has to pay for the license with ASCAP.*

**Indirect Sales - Individual Licenses**

If you want a Foo Fighters' song in your movie, you need a license. These deals can be more specific to the project. But still, they are tracked by ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC.

So if James Gunn wants a Foo Fighters song in his next Marvel Movie. This will be a much bigger deal than the blanket licenses, so Gunn will also need to get in contact with The Foo Fighters' label if they have one, and Dave Grohl will almost certainly be involved in the discussion. But Gunn gets all the contact information about it through ASCAP.

Gunn, the record label, and Foo Fighters will discuss a one time fee that James Gunn needs to pay for a license to the song as well as agree to a royalties rate. So Foo Fighters will get paid some percentage every time James Gunn's movie is also played with that song in it.

With a group as big as Foo Fighters, it is almost certain that Dave Grohl would be involved in that deal and given permission directly. Though that may not quite be the case. Sometimes record labels have control over movie use... but not when you're Dave Grohl.

So you have a one time deal AND royalties for every time the song is played with that content. This happens with movies, TV shows, radio shows, commercials, etc.

**Okay, What About Political Rallies?**

So with Blanket Licensing, Dave Grohl would have agree and give permission for you to use his music automatically when you sign up for the license with your bar, at your store, on your radio station, through Musak, etc. 

With Individual Licensing, Dave Grohl would have almost certainly given permission directly before signing the agreement.

If you have a major event at a venue and you plan to play music, you need a license. Even if your event isn't a profit making venture like a sports event, a comedy show, or whatever else, you need a license. **This would be a blanket license**.

A political rally is a major event that requires licenses for music (not to mention images, videos, etc).

It is incredibly unlikely that any major campaign would be oblivious to this.

It is so known that BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC all have information you can get if you want to use the music they license at your political events.

[Here is BMI's page on it](https://www.bmi.com/licensing/entry/political). They don't give much detailed info there, but the point is that you can get specific licenses for political events. [Here is ASCAP's information on it](https://www.bmi.com/licensing/entry/political). It is very long and even this is complicated.

In theory, a political campaign could easily get the wrong license for a political event and thus not have permission to play a song. They would have to rectify that.

However, the charge Dave Grohl is making is that HE did not give permission to the Trump campaign.

These event licenses are blanket licenses and are very likely included in the deals artists sign with ASCAP long long before they think any of their music will be played at a political rally.

**Any ASCAP artist could choose not to allow any campaign to play their music, but you would likely have to tell ASCAP ahead of time**

I doubt that these artists have that foresight. The smarter thing to do would be to tell ASCAP you don't want any political campaigns to use your music, and then if you want to let Harris use your music but not Trump, then you grant permission to Harris.

**Is it possible that Trump didn't bother getting a license?** Yeah, but that would be so profoundly stupid and costly that it is incredibly unlikely.

**Is it possible that Dave Grohl, Celine Dion, or any of these other artists actually refused permission in any legal way before Trump used their songs?** It's possible, but it is unlikely that Celine Dion or Dave Grohl saw Trump climbing in the polls in 2015 and thought to call their agents to tell ASCAP to not allow the Trump campaign to use their songs on a blanket licensing deal.

**It is far more likely that Dave Grohl didn't read all the ways ASCAP licenses his music, Trump's campaign licensed his music (which means Grohl gave permission whether he knew specifically or not), used his music at the rally and then Grohl was pissed and told X.com that he never gave permission, even though technically he did.**",Republicans
"I'm sorry, but my vote is not an economic one. I am of the opinion, as I'm sure many people are, that the economics of the U.S. are barely, if at all, controlled by the president. There is too much intervention by too much money from outside of the government making decisions for us. This in and of itself is certainly a huge problem, but it's pretty obvious to me that a change in president will not remotely solve the issue. 

To me, the larger issues are issues of civil liberties. And just as the issue of black slaves, women's right to vote, etc. (not to belittle other great progresses made by many other groups), changed this country for the better, a woman's right to choose and gay marriage are next on the list of great things we can accomplish.

And as usual, we are far behind the other progressive countries of the world (I wouldn't even honestly call the U.S. progressive at this point).

I am tired of the hipster 'moderate Republican' line that it is a toss-up favoring Obama. Why is it considered smart to equivocate and be a contrarian against the obvious facts? I read news from Drudge and if the polls were adjusted to show reasonable republican turnout levels (not Obama-2008 democrat vs republican turnout levels) we would be leading those polls in many important swing states. Romney will also win the popular vote. There are countless sources aggregated on Drudge that analyze this.
