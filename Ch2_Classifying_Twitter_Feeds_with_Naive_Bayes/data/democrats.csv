"I know it all Kamala and Walz, but just a little thank you to this guy too. He opened the door for change. "
I agree with Hamill here! 
"I’m continually stunned that his cult base has no moral bottom and will support this treasonous coward no matter what. 

It’s okay to change. It’s okay to receive new information and form a different opinion of someone or something. That’s personal growth. "
It’s confirmed! I can’t wait for her to Win
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
Anything I can send him to show some definitive proof Biden and Harris are not responsible for the high inflation and have actually been helping the problem and Trump would make it worse? 
"Best President of my adult lifetime. An outstanding Democrat and a good and decent man. Thank you, Mr. President. "
Now just have to hope the judge and appeals people don’t screw it up
"I spoke here earlier this year about being left by the Republican Party. Kamala reaffirmed my choice tonight. She spoke with dignity and composure to all Americans. I love Joe. I truly do. But I am 100% convinced Kamala is the right choice to move us forward. I have a 10 year old daughter. I hope she sees a woman President this year. 

And as a special education teacher, so t get me started on those who attacked Gov. Walz’s son!"
"I’m voting today, but I’m pessimistic at the moment and unsure if she will even when she’s leading just a little bit. What do you guys think?"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
I casted my ballot in AZ a few days ago ✅
Very presidential 
Took about an hour to cast my vote for the prosecutor!  Blue all the way down the ballot!
"My dad is a life long Republican voter, and my mom typically voted however he voted (to avoid ""offsetting his vote"".) I respect that peoples votes are private but needed someone to vent to after an argument with a sibling. I was so happy to learn both of my parents voted blue down the ballot. They are both very concerned about what Trump and his supporters represent. They are worried that Trump is a loose cannon and represents some of the worst people in the nation.

Feeling a bit more confident than I was a few days ago. Maybe we can finally sink the orange wannabe..."
"I’ve been voting since I was 18, we’re Appalachian and she always had pre-conceived notions about voting (she has always had a pretty progressive mindset, though). She’ll be 84 in November (also still works 30 hours a week!) and I’m so glad we finally got to share this together. "
Loved that quote from Biden’s SOTU
"A party dropping their nominee in any race rarely benefits said party and is at the very least a huge risk. This is NOT the kind of election where we should be taking that kind of risk, regardless of how necessary it may seem."
"He's really...losing it. This is wild.

This man can not become president. He is utterly, utterly UNFIT. "
"As an outsider regarding US politics, I want to know why you are choosing to vote for Kamala Harris.  I’m not familiar with her perspective, policies, or values other than from sensationalized media sources.  So please, list all of your reasons for supporting her, I’m genuinely curious."
Surprised ? 
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Election Day is almost here…you got this, sir!

"But don’t worry, he “trusts women” and it has nothing to do with the recent IVF bans…"
"i guess he's not lactose intolerant because he is really milking **TFFFFF** out of those bandaids...   

if ANYONE is to lay claim that they were ""forced to take a bullet for democracy"", it is **Corey Comperatore**, who **died** an *actual* HERO protecting his family!   

**THE ONLY THING TRUMP TOOK WAS STOLEN VALOR**   

trump is a vile, disgusting waste of flesh and air. FULL STOP 🛑

"Is Kamala, Tim, and team bringing in the people.  We have enthusiasm with the Democrats!"
I will forever be a Tim Walz fan- I hope he and his family are doing well 😊 I also hope this isn’t the last we will see of him on a National scale:) 
"With Democrats lining up in support of Harris at the top of the ticket, who do you think should be VP? This could be broken into two parts: who do you think would be a good pick politically? And who would you be excited to see?"

This is my husband. He is a Gulf War veteran. He worked 12 hours today as a mechanic (like he does every day). He came home, ate dinner, drank a beer, and helped me pack a few more boxes for our upcoming move out of this shitty apartment where we have lived for the last five years because housing is so freaking expensive where we live. (Obligatory fuck you to the greedy property management corps and Air BnBs who own goddamn everything around us). He is still wearing his dirty work uniform and is so tired that he hasn’t even showered yet because our work isn’t quite over for the day. He is taking a quick break to watch a few of the speeches before getting back to the task. He doesn’t complain though. No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion. My husband the veteran doesn’t want Traitor Trump to ever get near the White House again and he is so tired of the GOP and their negativity, fascist tendencies, and deeply skewed version of “patriotism.” My man is a hard working patriot and is voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. 

 Y’all…LET’S DO THIS! #YesWeCan! #Harris/Walz2024 #VoteBlue "
"This holiday season, be sure to discuss the dangers of drinking raw milk with your MAGA friends and family. Hopefully, they will begin or increase consumption of raw milk just to “own the libs.” 
On a related note, if you get COVID, be sure to attend get togethers with MAGA. "
I can't believe there are people that consider him an actual journalist.  
"White female Catholic over 40 here. The choice was obvious, even for those of us who “ought” to be Republican "
"Is this real? I’ve seen a few reports, and all the numbers are about the same. Why? What could possibly be your excuse to blow it off? We lost so much across the board last night because of this. "
Saw this while driving in Ohio!!
It’s actually shameful what these spoilers have become. They’re nothing more than another cog in the Russian propaganda scheme to get Trump elected. If this doesn’t show horseshoe theory is real idk what will. 
You know she did this on purpose!
My mother who is a life long republican just filled out her absentee ballot for our girl and our coach while singing Freedom by 👑 🐝  I know it won’t make a difference in our state but I do have hope in our country. And beyond that. This is a proud daughter moment she knows Bey lyrics. 💙❤️🤍
polls not even closed yet...here we go! 
"I live in a middle of nowhere farm country town surrounded by Trump flags and signs everywhere I see, but not all of us country folk are so ignorant. You see, for the rights of my mixed girlfriend, our economy not getting ruined by Trump tariffs, basic human decency, and a brighter future for our beautiful country, I made sure to get out and vote for Harris. If you haven’t already, please get out and vote y’all!"
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
"Personally, my favorite Dem right now is Mayor Pete. He is by far the best messenger and communicator in the party. He routinely goes on Fox and humiliates the pundits, it’s incredible. Honorable mention to Raphael Warnock. Dude knows how to give a speech!"

"I remember spending hours on hold with the CDC trying to get the Cue reusable COVID testing equipment, just to be told i needed to call CMS. I spent hours on hold with CMS, to just get told I needed to call the CDC.

During all of this bullshit, it turns out we never had the machines I needed, because they were getting shipped out to Russia and Saudi Arabia.

We were spraying our masks with hand sanitizer, trying to find ways to sanitize gloves sucessfully, literally run to local stores hoping they had medical swabs we could put to use.


Fuck Donald Trump. Seriously. I always knew this dude was a POS, but this has honestly fucking enraged me."
"When Biden stepped aside and said Kamala is the taking over...my literal words were oh no.

After more and more stories/perspective came out of Biden stepping aside when he did to let the Republicans trash him at the convention and then let Kamala run full steam ahead afterwards...I was like oh yes

And then just watching her campaign, talk, and actually talk like most of us think while still giving political policies and actually not taking the high road in talking about Republicans like they've done to us for so many years

Then picking waltz who is just, maybe, the best pick we could've gotten for a vp...likeable, and hardly a shroud of negativity except maybe exiting the military after giving proper notice and before his time to leave for Iraq..the nerve

So how does everyone's thoughts of Kamala from day 1 of running to now differ?

I'm glad I was wrong about her and hopefully she can continue this if she becomes president and give more hope to this country again, it's sad that it's still a maybe."
"so along with China tariffs hurting American businesses and farmers...now he's gonna stop ALL imports based on the imaginary ""caravan"" that got him elected. and he will still find a way to blame Democrats for it when his little minions start to catch on and revolt.

I hate this goddamn timeline."
"I can't make out the ""paid for by"" at the bottom but I saw 2 of these a few miles apart in Cobb County, GA. Love it. What do y'all think about this? I love to see it but curious how effective you think it might be?"
This will be my first election not voting Republican. Wish I would have done it sooner!
"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
"The last one is mine! 🎃 I saw about twice as many, but you can only add 20 pictures. 🤣 Not a single sign for ""the other guy"" to be found.  I know that many of you live in red cities/counties/states, so here's a reminder that we're out here! 💙"
"The unification of the party and massive wave of support for Kamala Harris is MASSIVE. 

That being said… *can we all shake hands and agree that we won’t throw a fit if our preferred VP candidate isn’t chosen?* The last thing we need is the “she just lost my vote” crew to make headlines showing division. 

We have a deep bench. They are all good in different ways. Let’s keep the momentum!"
"If we flip Texas, there is a zero possibility of Trump winning the election. Turn Texas Blue!"
"This is the first time in months that I genuinely feel optimistic about US politics, before my mindset was kinda ""I don't like Biden much but I'm gonna keep him out because I despise Trump"" and I think that was a lot of people's mindset (especially since I consider myself more left wing than the average Democrat) and I even planned to leave the country if either of them won. But now that it's Kamala as the nominee, my attitude is that I'm perfectly content with voting for her, in fact, I am Proud that my first vote in a presidential election will go towards Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, granted I still plan to prepare to leave the country, get my passport, visa, etc. But basically my plan now is I'm gonna do stuff to prepare, but if Kamala wins I can chill here longer, get my degree probably you know, all that good stuff. But I am actually very optimistic about this election (although we should never be cocky or let our guard down) anybody else kinda feel this way?"
Don’t fall for it! 
I don’t ever trust the polls. I mean look at the Boebert thing alone but damn I’m seeing every opinion possible lol I’m ready for this to be over with. My wife and I already did our part while trying to flip Indiana so it’s just a waiting game now 
"I live in Brevard County, which is a pretty conservative area and was talking to a guy in the grocery store. He was telling me HE ABSOLUTELY will not accept another 4 from a Democrat and would surely cause a riot. I sometimes feel the tensions from right wing people against the left more and more. "
"There have been stories of some people realizing that a Trump victory actually goes against their interests. Does anyone have any stories of this happening?

I’ll start. I have a Republican coworker who depends on Auto Zone to buy parts for his aging vehicles. When I told him the business plans to raise prices due to Trump’s tariffs, became upset. "
Vote!
"For the first time in my life, I was drawn out to vote. 

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

Donald Trump is not fit to be the next president of the United States."

"""nO oNe VoTeD fOr HaRrIs"" I DID. I was registered for the Democratic primary in my state, I checked the box for Joe Biden, I was informed enough to know that was short hand for the Biden/Harris ticket. With the President's advanced age I was aware that there was a greater than average chance that Harris would step up into that role, and I was comfortable with that ticket. I voted for the ticket with Harris on it in the primary, I'll vote for the ticket with Harris on it for the election. No problem seen.

I know that the 'no one voted for Harris' argument isn't legitimate, it's just the other side of the aisle trying to invent a wedge issue to break down Democratic support. They're all pointless, bad faith arguments, this one just gets under my skin. No matter how many tactics the GOP try, I will be in that voting booth on election day, and I will be voting for any Democrat, and if that Democrat is Kamala Harris, it will be pleasure vote, and not only a necessity."

"Without catastrophizing, what can we do now? I have an LGBTQ+ child who is terrified. Thankfully we live in a very blue state but wtf can I do - what can WE ALL do - to prevent the most minimal amount of damage done to our already fragile democracy? 
I'm not involved in politics, I don't have a large platform, I'm only one person...but how can we keep ourselves safe while also helping prevent the death of democracy? I'm sad and frustrated and lost and I don't know what to do to fight back. Is there any point?"
"Bought a ton of Kamala signs. Handed them out and put some in prominent places.

Removed a bunch of Trump signs that had been placed in concrete cracks on the median of an interstate, too close to the road.

Got poison ivy multiple times in this journey and multiple cracked windshields.

Attended a rally.

Bought merch for friends and family.

Spent hours debunking claims on Rumble and Truth.

Managed to get the Dilbert guy to read a pro-Kamala message on his Rumble pod.

Donated to the campaigns.

Wore my Kamala camo hat around Florida and North Carolina.

It was a tough fight, gave it a good try."

"Hi everyone,

I lean conservative but respect everyone’s position of course on who they want to vote for. Only way to understand each other more is by asking questions. Not fighting.

I am asking this question with genuine curiosity not hostility. 

I can understand not liking Trump but what do you see in Kamala other than the fact she isn’t Joe Biden and she isn’t Trump? What do you think she would do for this country?"

"I have people in my life that I really care about who still think our country will be better off with him as president and I don't know how to deal with this mindset. I know they think the economy will be better off and they will have more money in their pocket, but what are you thinking?? "

"America, this is not gonna be easy to accept; but, as someone who *survived* an *attempted murder* at the hands of an **abusive, malignant narcissist**: *you're in an abusive relationship*  

i **understand** the constant gaslighting is exhausting. 

i **understand** it's infuriating that his enablers make excuses for him.  

i **understand** it's heartbreaking when everyone around him ignores everything they see and hear and pretend nothing happened.   

i **understand** a new set of rules seems to be invented just for him, and him *only*.

i **understand** its triggering to keep being told you're ""overreacting"".

i **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him ""blow off steam""

i **understand** his enablers are just as terrified of him, and that's why they keep supporting him.  

i **understand** when the courts keep giving him another chance to come back and finish the job.  

i **understand** the constant feelings of impending doom everytime he's present

i **understand** feeling isolated and questioning yourself and wondering if everyone else is right when they say you're just ""being too sensitive"" and reduces everything he does into a ""joke"" that you ""misunderstood"" 

i **understand** never being able to hide from or avoid him.   

i **understand** losing friends and family because he keeps lying to them and you can't change their minds, even when you show them the receipts. 

i **understand** because i *survived* it.  

But America, all is **not lost** and you are **not** crazy. Everything you feel is valid. Everything you have experienced **really did happen to you**. you **will** come out of this stronger, happier and better. 

I know that seems impossible to even imagine right now. i know you feel lost and defeated, but i promise you are not alone. i know it's terrifying to think about and predict his reaction based on all the times you tried to get out of this relationship, but *you have to cut all ties with him*. you have to get him out of your house. you have to pile all his crap on the curb. you have to change the locks. you have to block all contact and refuse to listen to anyone who advocates for him. but, you **can** escape him.     

America, you **have to vote** and you **have to vote for Joe Biden**. that's the *only* way you **survive** this abusive relationship. **you're not a victim America, you're a survivor** never forget that.  

With love and compassion,  
A concerned citizen"

Where those two failed to really land a knockout against him 
"I have been seeing this very misguided idea floating around this sub, so I’ve decided to put it to rest by calculating the remaining vote and seeing how we can expect it to add up. I’m only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I’m not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I’ll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California — 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris’s favor):

Harris — 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon — 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris — 257,107 votes
Trump — 197,631 votes

Washington — 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris — 297,296 votes
Trump — 198,028 votes

Maryland — 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris — 333,894 votes
Trump — 201,877 votes

Arizona — 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris — 384,839 votes
Trump — 433,563 votes

Nevada — 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris — 63,416 votes
Trump — 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I’ll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris — 75,054,105 
Trump — 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

So no, it is not true that we lost because “20 million Democrats just couldn’t get off the couch.” Unfortunately, there was just an overall substantial rightward shift, which aligns with the incumbency disadvantage we’ve been seeing globally due to inflation. "

"Of the two candidates, one of them absolutely obsessed with size. The size of the stock market, the size of his crowds, the size of … other things, and relevant to this post, the size of his vote share.

Even if you know your vote isn’t changing the way the electoral college goes, your vote will make Kamala’s number bigger and the bigger her share of the vote, the more infuriated we’ll make him.

Do your part: cast your vote and piss off Donald Trump!"
Can we all agree to suspend our X accounts already? This man is unhinged. 
"I have historically been a “best person for the job” voter, not loyal to any party. But Trump has so corrupted the Republican Party that I cannot believe any candidate with an R by their name can be trusted to abide by our nation’s laws and govern in a moral, respectful manner. I stuff in line for an hour voted early in Tennessee (with my wife) and hope my vote can do some good to stop the literal insanity that is degrading American politics at all levels of our government.
Please vote!"

"Was a live long republican and even voted for Trump in 2016.  Then his disastrous presidency turned me into a Never Trumper but still republican - even voted for Biden as a Republican.  Then Roe V. Wade got overturned and I changed my party affiliation from R to D.  The Republican Party was no longer the party of small government to me.  Plus I’ve always been socially liberal.

Now watching the DNC, seeing the hope and true joy and energy the base has.  I freakin’ love it.  It feels good to be part of this.  Michelle’s speech was amazing and Obama’s speech is going strong right now.

My choice has even affected my kids as they are seemingly more openly liberal now.

Just wanted to say: I’m proud to say my party affiliation without the need to have to defend it with technicalities that I felt I had to before.  I’m a democrat now.  The reason: because I have a heart and want to do what’s right.  Simple enough and the truth."

In the past few weeks I’ve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. 

These are the topics that are changing minds:
1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn’t want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.
2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don’t like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let’s be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November?

My mom and I are kind of in a heated discussion about, of course, politics. She’s reposting things on Facebook that essentially accuse the Democratic Party of choosing our candidate for us and that it’s never been done in the history of the country, yada yada. It seems dangerously close to the “Kamala did a coup!!!!!!” argument I see a lot online.

My question is, how exactly does the Democratic Party (and the other one too, I suppose) choose a candidate? I’m not old enough to have voted in a lot of elections, just since 2016. But I don’t remember the people choosing Hilary, it seemed like most Dems I knew were gung-ho about Bernie and were disappointed when Hilary was chosen over him. I guess I was always under the impression that we don’t have a whole lot of say in who is chosen as candidate, and I’m just wondering how much of that is true and how much of it is naivety.

"I’m actually heartbroken over this. As a black woman, I live in a country where people would rather have a racist, bigoted, fascist, felon as president than another decent hardworking black woman. Upset is an understatement. 
The fact that he won, is appalling, and hard to wrap my head around. 
The fact that he won so easily, that there was seemingly no chance is so depressing
The fact that he might actually win the popular vote too is isolating and downright scary.
I'm a woman of color, I have never felt so betrayed, so scared, so…so empty.
I live in a country where 70 million people think I shouldn’t have rights as a woman to thrive. 70 million people see me and my immigrant family as subhuman. 70 million people that don’t care that this man is keen on setting us to the days of McCarthyism and beyond.

"Can someone send this memo to Jon Stewart?

I am so fucking sick of Stewart’s incessant bitching. I know Stewart and his fanboys fancy him the intellectual authority on all things but the “YOUR OLD! PEOPLE WANT TO BE INSPIRED!” take isn’t exactly cutting edge.

And didn’t we already try that in 2008? I seem to remember the change that followed the “inspiration” being too incremental and that resulted in a bunch of voters staying home in 2016 and landing us in this mess to begin with. 

Maybe an “intellectual” like Stewart should try educating his viewers instead of just riling up anger. Biden’s record is the most effective of a single term since LBJ. Even if you disagree with his agenda (and from what I can tell, his left leaning critics don’t disagree with his agenda, just his age), he has governed effectively.  But by all means

Look, if “I am voting to save small ‘d’ democracy so you can have the option to vote again in the future” doesn’t inspire you, I don’t know what will. 

Because clearly pulling our country back from the brink of economic collapse and a public health dumpster fire (that the last administration dumped fuel on top of) didn’t do it for you. Nor did ending our longest running war or masterfully handling every foreign policy crisis that has presented. Or his steps toward marijuana reform. Or his historic infrastructure package. Or the billions of forgiven student loans. Or record pace of judicial appointments that will hopefully undo some of the damage McConnell has done to the federal judiciary. 

Nor does that concept of giving the Presidency back to a convicted felon right after the Supreme Court has made a roadmap to using the Presidency to carry out self-interested illegality up to, and including, ORDERING THE ASSASSINATION OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS!

It’s funny that Stewart considers himself such a savvy critic on mainstream media, given that he is pushing their same nonsensical talking points. Looks like the dude bought into his own hype so much that he cannot even see he’s become the thing he devoted his career to criticizing. 

So, Mr. Stewart, to you I say — will you shut up, man?

Win by 2 is still on but it’s desperate 
"I’m deeply disappointed and troubled by the direction our country has taken with the re-election of Donald Trump, along with the strengthening of Republican majorities in Congress. This decision feels like a setback for so many of the values we cherish and protect. Trump’s previous administration was rife with mistakes and troubling actions—disregard for science, mishandling of the pandemic, divisive rhetoric, repeated challenges to the rule of law, and policies that harmed marginalized communities. These actions, to me, have been at odds with the leadership our country truly needs.

Giving Republicans control of both houses in Congress also threatens some of the most important aspects of our democracy and well-being. It’s likely we will see shifts in the Supreme Court with lasting effects on reproductive rights, which are fundamental to our autonomy. Support for Ukraine and America’s role in international stability may be questioned, leaving allies vulnerable. And policies that provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in our society—families struggling to make ends meet, communities fighting for access to healthcare, and children in need of safety and support—could face drastic cuts and neglect.

In the face of this moment, I can’t help but feel a deep need for reflection as a country. How did we arrive here, making decisions that seem to run so counter to the values of equity, compassion, and progress? There’s a real need to look inward, to have those difficult conversations, and to work toward an understanding of how we can move forward better and stronger.

And yet, my heart is heavy thinking about waking my daughter—again—for the second time in her young life to tell her that the glass ceiling of a woman president remains unbroken. For all the hope and progress that has marked her short life, this reminder of how far we still have to go feels especially painful.

I am also deeply concerned about the continued presence of election interference, both foreign and domestic. Misinformation, threats of retribution, and even false bomb threats targeting polling centers to discourage likely Democratic voters have cast a shadow over our democratic process. This isn’t simply about who wins or loses; it’s about the integrity of our elections and the faith we place in them to truly represent the voice of the people.

To those feeling hurt, confused, and scared—I am right there with you. This isn’t just a matter of disappointment; it’s a profound worry about the future of our country and the values we hold dear. I feel the weight of this decision on a personal level, as many of you likely do. It’s a time of uncertainty, and I know I’m not alone in feeling anxious about what lies ahead. I want you to know that every one of your concerns, fears, and frustrations is valid. We are in this together, sharing the same questions and the same hopes, even as we struggle to make sense of this moment.

As we look to the future, it’s more unpredictable than it’s been in a long time, and that unpredictability is unsettling. We are likely facing challenges that will push us all in ways we haven't imagined, yet despite everything, we must hold tight to the idea that this is not the end of our story. Democracy, though it may feel fragile right now, finds strength in the bonds that connect us—in the courage of communities that stand up for what’s right and in the compassion of people who look out for each other when times are tough. We are not powerless, and we are not without hope.

And there are reasons for hope. In this election, some incredible firsts remind us of the progress we are capable of. In Delaware, Sarah McBride has made history as the first openly trans member of Congress, a powerful step toward inclusion. Many states, including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and New York, have taken action to protect reproductive freedom in their constitutions, and Illinois has expanded access to IVF by requiring insurance coverage. Several states across the country have guaranteed sick leave and increased access to marijuana, while California, Colorado, and Hawaii have removed bans on same-sex marriage from their constitutions. These victories show that, even when national outcomes disappoint, there are still powerful moments of progress worth celebrating.

This might be a dark chapter, but our shared commitment to justice, equality, and progress is a powerful light. Together, with resilience and unity, we can still shape a future that reflects the best of who we are. While the immediate path may be hard to see, we can carry each other forward. Let’s not forget that we have the power to create change—and no election outcome can ever take that from us.

With hope, resilience, and a belief in the promise of our future,
-Jake"
"A couple days ago it was insane to me that it was even a debate who will win; now I am witnessing Trumps lead and I can‘t believe my eyes. How the fuck are millions and millions of people using their rights to get their rights taken away from them??

"The odds were always against Kamala. Not only is she a person of color like myself. She is also a woman. And so many people I know who are full of ignorance said ""a woman is not fit to be president"". The amount of women I know who refused to vote for her was pathetic. United we stand and divide we fall. And we definitely were divided. And I wish people stop saying Trump is going to prevent another election in 2028. It's not gonna happen. Did Biden give enough time before he made the announcement that he was endorsing Kamala, did Trump really win or did his goons help? Did Biden have a better chance at winning? Who knows. I do know this we have to try and hold out heads up high. I know it will be hard but we have to try. "

There is life after the trumps and these people should be treated with the due attention and disrespect for what they’ve done
"I like what Joe has  archived and recognize his accomplishments. However, that doesn't win this election. It's a Turd vs an old man. Like it or not that's what American's see. Schumer is talking about this with large donors as well.

Running into a burning building to help save a woman to shoveling snow for with people after a nasty storm. He is a Rhodes Scholar. This part is  completely superficial but the American public  regardless of Party are more likely to vote for the more attractive candidates. An example is the  Nixon Kennedy debates. People who listened on a radio thought Nixon was better. The people watching the debate thought Kennedy, who was tan and in good shape won. Nixon and the camera weren't friends.

"First reminder: Secretary Clinton was first lady of a state and then the nation, then was elected to the senate twice, then was picked as Secretary of State by the sitting Democratic president. 

Second reminder: Sanders started his campaign by saying that he would [never go negative against Hillary Clinton](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/240654-sanders-says-he-wont-go-negative-against-hillary). 

As things are clearly going badly off the rails for the Sanders campaign, we should do a better job of keeping at least some shred of reality in mind here and not let ourselves get eaten up by the desperate propaganda-mill of Bernie Sanders. "
"The link below archives tax returns for various public officials and presidential candidates. Five of the original seventeen Republican candidates for president in 2016 released various tax returns for various years. On the Democratic side, two of the original six candidates released various tax returns for various years.

Hillary Clinton released fifteen years worth of complete tax returns, from 2000 to 2014.

Bernie Sanders released only one year of partial tax returns -- 2014 -- and did not release any of the attachments, like what charitable donations he made (if any) and what deductions he took. (We know he took deductions above the standard level because of the relevant line on the partial return that he released.)

So this leaves us wondering: **What is Bernie Sanders Hiding? Why won't he release more tax returns? Why didn't he release his full 2014 return?**

"This is way way too close, and uncapping the house would make the EC vote more accurately represent the will of the people. All it would take is repealing the reapportionment act of 1929.

"Not sure how much of a history geek you are, but I (late gen x) grew up learning about WW2 extensively. Primarily because of my grandfather - who served in the Navy, dodging kamikazes in the Pacific, surviving the Battle of Midway, and served his country admirably. I cannot imagine the horrors that man lived 24/7 during that war. He was 16 when the greatest conflict in human history broke out. Did he dodge the draft with a doctor’s note, citing ‘bone spurs’, like Captain Slapnuts?? No, he fought against an imperialist aggressor waging war. He wasn’t sympathetic to them, he didn’t side with them, and he sure as shit didn’t willingly vote them into office. But I digress.  

The result of this election is absolute horseshit. Seemingly fair and square, thus far. But still horse shit. Moving forward, as Democrats, we need resolve. We mustn’t give up our fight. Truth and righteousness **is on our side**.

Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister during the Second World War, gave a speech on June 4th, 1940. History will remember him as a racist, subscripting to superiority of the British empire, but as a young American learning about world history and that terrible war, I viewed him as a leader that Britain needed at the time. I see parallels in what Britain faced at the time and our situation now - but for us the Nazis have **actually landed on the goddamned beaches**. To quote Jeffrey Lebowski, *the other Jeffrey Lebowski*, “the plane has crashed into the mountain!!”

As we move forward as a party, we need the resolve the Brits had before and during that war. When faced with overwhelming hardships, they fought. When facing a determined enemy bend on their destruction, they were steadfast. When German bombers attempted to completely crush their will, they endured. 

Sorry for the long post, but I have a lot on my mind. Im sure most of you do also. I would like to present you with a small portion of that famous speech, lifted from the end of it, if you wish to seek it out and listen for yourself. Fight. Endure. Persist. 

> I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and **to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.** At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. *We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender*, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."

All these news commentary channels lean heavily in favor of Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nominee. That is fine. Maybe they have the wisdom we need about that. However, I don't think that it's right for them to waste a lot of breath attacking Pete Buttigieg.

In my view, these pontificators are trying to make the Democratic nomination process into one where we judge the candidates on the basis of their personality.

Some people may believe that Bernie Sanders is the most principled person, because he will fight for the cause of the Progressive Left. 

I personally disagree. I believe that Buttigieg and Yang are the most principled people, because they are gentle and smart... and have strong convictions that will always inform the way that they work with their teams."
"I wanted to share something yesterday, and I really thought about it long and hard, I just want you to understand my pain and anguish about the aftermath of what happened:

Tuesday night, I went home and went to bed hoping against hope that this red monster, would never ever get back in the white house. When I woke up Wednesday morning and saw the final results, that's when my rage exploded! I've been crying ever since.

 I am not only angry, I am absolutely furious with every single citizen who has betrayed America to the fullest by voting for Donald Trump because of so-called money! They say greed is good, it is not!

 Money and greed are the root of all evils! I was fighting for @kamalaharris because I wanted to fight for the people especially those with physical and mental needs who have not been heard! And now, with this monster back in the White House to become dictator, my greatest fear is that our rights as individuals with special needs will be totally destroyed and taken away for good. This is my heartbreaking fear and something I wish I did not have to say.

I also have something to say to all the women who I fought so very hard for in trying to protect their right to their own choices: words alone cannot express my deepest grief, nor my deepest sorrow, as to how much I and many others have failed to stop this monster, and I cannot tell you how sorry I am enough! 😔😭

But I am not going to give up fighting but I am going to fight like absolute furious hell in more ways than one. And not only that, but I'm going to hold all those accountable in the name of justice, by calling them out and acknowledging their guilt for turning their back on this country and not electing a woman as president of the United States.... Again! 

It happened before in 2016 when we had Hillary Clinton concede to Donald Trump and now Kamala! As an autistic person, I am very disappointed, very angry, and outraged, there is going to be a day of great atoning coming when they realize that Trump is the liar and deceiver of all humankind. And I will say to them, ""see, I told you so!""

 Please ....protect our young people with special needs, protect their rights, and so much more!"
Please give me some comfort. 
"I know about spreading fake news and trolling online by the Russians, but what I’m asking is what is stopping the Russians from turning the 2020 election from a normal and fair one, to one that we would see in House of Cards? Where even if the Democratic candidate got the popular vote and the electoral college vote, what’s stopping Russia from hacking the whole thing in Trumps favor. I don’t mean to make people worry but it’s something that has been on my mind for a while and I’m starting to wonder about it. I’m thinking that since the midterms were not hacked to keep us from gaining the house maybe there is some hope for the 2020 election."

"I recommend watching all of this but for the topic of what I’d like to discuss skip to 6:45.

After this election, there has to be a realization that politics are changing with the times. The DNC likes cookie cutter candidates and fear public backlash. Donald Trump has proven that a candidate can say and do WHATEVER they want and some Americans (70+ million to be exact) will still vote for him bc of promises to change the status quo. This status quo is what they view as causing all of their problems, whether or not it actually is. This is why we saw so many Bernie supporters flip to Trump. A large part of this country HATES the Dem establishment that still coddles billionaires and acts holier than thou. 

The working class of this country are PLEADING for change. Pleading for someone, like Bernie, to call out the corruption and change the system we live in and that cannot be disregarded any longer.   Its resulted in people believing Trump is either the answer or not a big enough threat to our entire way of life bc the status quo is that bad. 

If we wish to fight for social issues, we have to hear these people and accept their issues into our platform. Additionally, we have to recognize the importance of being a good spokesman for your message. In this video, Kyle suggests Jon Stewart as the next candidate which i tend to agree with. Of course, I’d love it to have the politician version of Stewart but we may be in a position politically where celebrity gives the party the best chance to win. Maybe “vibes” are just that important to swing voters. Another person mentioned by a friend of mine was Mark Ruban. Hes a self defined lifelong republican but recently hes taken social stances on economic issues which i really like.

What do we think? Do we think this strategy would benefit us in the next election? "
"My first ever vote was for Beto in the 2018 midterms. I also supported Beto in the primaries but now I, along with Beto and the movement he started here in Texas, am completely behind Joe 2020. I believe in the power of hope over fear. I believe in running like we're 10 points ahead rather than like we're 10 points behind, in treating Trump like what he is, an old racist who represents a shrinking minority rather than an evil genius playing 4-D chess. I believe in the soul of our country. And I believe the path to a better future will start on November 3rd, 2020, when Joe takes Trump to the cleaners in an EC landslide. We can make it happen. It's time for Democrats to dream again. And oh yeah...let's turn Texas blue this year :)"
"Seriously. If a Trumpster gets in again, we'll end up like Russia, where one party wins every ""election"" and a few token parties end up in the equivalent of Congress. They won't fail to stay in power again, mark my words. You simply don't fuck that up twice.

It sucks knowing that half the people in Congress don't love the concept of the United States and the 330+ million people who live here, and would tear everything down just for power. Fucking disgusting. "
"Thankfully Biden is winning but ultimately we need to defeat Trump and we need as much help as we can obtain.

I believe that this is the best way for us to retain Bernie Sanders voters and to defeat Trump. Since defeating Trump is not their main issue chances are many of them would not vote for Biden. Also, Bernie has sadly been beating Biden in large numbers with the young vote, independents and Latinos even in states where Bernie lost. I believe we need as much help as we can get. In my opinion its better to be safe then to be sorry. 

What are your opinions on this?"
"I've been a democrat my whole life. I don't think I have ever agreed with Republicans on anything. But I'm sick of the hatred both parties and their supporters are feeding into. We demonize Republicans as racist, sexist, homophobic, etc and they demonize us as being anti-american and unrealistic. Maybe Republicans are all racist, maybe Democrats are naive, but that doesn't change the fact that we are all Americans and we all have to share this great country which we both love. If someone says or does racist things, call them out. But if you call any Republican who doesn't actively fight against everything Trump's administration does a racist then you are no different than the people screaming fake news at any news story they don't like. We can't survive as a nation where half of the people hate the other half."
"if Hillary wins the nomination, there WILL be a REPUBLICAN WHITE HOUSE in 2017. I don't even have any illusions anymore. Hillary is what the GOP should be, and Bernie is what the Democratic party should be. 

at the end of the day, I hope my assessment is wrong, but I hoped I was wrong about GW Bush v Kerry, too. "
"Whether it is posting *multiple* articles on the *exact same subject*, constantly decrying Bernie supporters as ""Bernie Bros"", or accusing Bernie supporters of using GOP-like tactics, I'm getting really sick of it. 

Let's be very clear, Hillary supporters: **YOU NEED US TO AVOID A GOP WHITE HOUSE**

For Bernie supporters, this primary is very emotional. We want to avoid a GOP presidency and therefore support the candidate who, according to all available evidence, is more likely to attract the necessary independent voters to win. But more importantly than that, we see Bernie's candidacy as the best shot we've ever had to fundamentally reform our electoral system. Never before have we seen a candidate who is this grassroots. If Bernie doesn't win, we are scared that won't have another shot at this for a long, long time. My personal guess is 16-24 years (based on recent history). 

So, every time Hillary supporters take pot shots at Bernie or his supporters, every time they dismiss his transformative candidacy, every time they run up the score by trying to show us just how much the media believe Hillary will win, every time they openly celebrate a Hillary win without recognizing how emotional this is for is...well, simply put, they push us farther away. Get it through your heads: **we are sick of the establishment.** We are already disinclined to rally behind Hillary--stop making it even harder. That is, unless you want President Trump. "

Hillary Clinton was damn right when she got pissed at that Greenpeace protester. Sanders is running a very disturbing and disgusting campaign, almost at the level of Donald Trump. I know for months I've been saying ""Bernie or Bust "" is stupid. But you know what, do what you want. I was watching Secular Talk, and Kyle said that that of you live in a swing state you have to suck it up and vote for Hillary or Bernie. But if you live in a democratic safe state, vote your heart. My heart won't let me vote for Sanders, so I never will, and that's okay because I live in New Mexico, a safe state.  So vote for heart and play politics well.

EDIT: Bernie Sanders supporters just a heads up you might be upset at the MSM today. If Cruz wins Wisconsin, and Bernie wins Wisconsin, the media will be dominated by Cruz his victory over. They won't even talk about Bernie Sanders. It will put a serious crimp in his momentum campaign. And if Wisconsin is closed like the polls are saying, Hillary Clinton still walks away with a healthy amount of delegates."
"I understand it’s gonna do a lot of damage to people who didn’t vote for it, but the people voted for this.

Foreign affairs is about to get dicey. The Middle East is a powder keg.  Russia and China are not our friends. But somehow, the people voted for this.

I’m lost. I don’t understand. But, the people voted for this."
Trump is a fraud. He’s been all his life. 
"
Pretty Fkng please 😁🇺🇸😄😐🫤😑"
"Bernie will defund the US military, in favor of entitlement programs, which is \*exactly what Russia wants\*.

He will further divide the left and right in our country, which is also, \*exactly what Russia wants\*.

Divide, and Conquer.

Anything that makes the USA weaker and creates infighting, they will support.

Why this is not registering, I have no idea. It seems there are millions of voters out there that have not made this connection.

Bernie fans, hate me for speaking the truth. My post is not meant to agitate. But I fear that with either candidate, Russia will increase its world dominance at our expense.

Polarization is bad for the country. Period. Both the far right and far left need to move closer to the middle for our country to be functional. That's the unfortunate reality as much as I agree with some of Bernie's ideas. 

Now if anyone thinks I'm talking out my ass, read this:

"I'm a nobody. Simple 'federal' employee making not enough. Married and desperately trying to start our family. I'm a die hard blue democrat too. Young, white male. Logic and reason is paramount to how I think. So take what I suggest with a grain of salt perhaps.

So. 

HOW TO WIN.


First things first tho, about Kamala. 

I'm sure she is a real-ass person, a lady and overall lovely human being. A fierce prosecutor. And firm AG. A brilliant senator. And a fine VP. Just not good enough to the masses. The media bobbled it totally, maybe on purpose. She got railroaded. He of course, they love to shine a turd, don't they???

Anyway.

It's all about selling a candidate to the audience, right? 

In this outrageous media and political climate, it's all imagery. The masses want someone in particular, they just don't know it yet.

The DNC needs an ace down in the farm system. LITERALLY.

They need to find a mid to late 30's or early 40's straight white male. He HAS to be a lawyer. A real good one too. Smart. Charismatic. Sharp as a tack. Good-looking. And a good dad and eagle scout husband. No bones in his closet.

And finally, he has to be a democrat thru and thru. Well, sorta. Maybe with moderate leanings to simple palatable policies. Immigration. Simple capitalist economics. Liberty and personal sovereignty. That type of shit. Easy to market.

He has to be from a small to medium-sized city. 150,000 to 370,000 population city. A bluish or purplish city. IN A RED STATE.

Not an activist. But a guy that cares for his clients. Taking up good causes and cases. 

You offer him the position. Hopefully he says yes. 

Then you POUR MONEY into campaigning his local 2026 house campaign.

Trump 2.0 backed by that dipshit Musk is gonna tear the economy apart. 100%

So you run him. This John Smith III.

He charms the dumb masses with his down home attitude. His laser sharp clarity reaches into their dumb little heads and grabs em! He simplifies the issues they are dealing with. And offers simple, reasonable solutions to the chaos. 

John Smith III wins his seat in the US House. 

As America grinds to a halt and panic world over ensues, you POUR MONEY into his media debut. Boost the ever-loving fuck out of him. Show him fighting for his constituents. Tearing apart the GOP and the idiocy of all their plans. He needs to be a political pitbull.

Then you capture the masses of morons that obviously inhabit our wonderful country. 

And you run him in 2028.

THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING WIN.

Just listened to an episode of Pod Saves America and they interviewed Dean Phillips in it. 

Although I think it’s risky business to run right now; I respect a lot of the responses he had. In saying that, haven’t done a lot of research on him."
"Hey, i want to start of with that im a Bernie supporter and a democrat, love the guy, love the movement, and the ideas of change. There is no question that Biden had a big win in SC. But waking up this morning, watching twitter trending #dropoutbernie , or people who i see as democrats wakelessly slander Bernie sanders. And i get it , there are also parts of bernies supporters who do the same, but its genuinly extremely tiring to see people who are #bluenomatterwhat when they an hour later trash on bernie.

Its made me extremely dissillusioned with this party, and i know many who feel the same. Should Biden or a non bernie candidate win, congratulations to that person il vote for him, to defeat Trump, but i do know that those same people who trash bernie and his supporters, will try to do the mantra of votingbluenomatter what , while then sugarcoating bernie supporters after months of trashing them, is this really how people here want to go forward? Are we not going to address the amount of trolling that has been made towards bernie?

Im really not trying to divide anything here, but i would lie if i told you this has made me less of a proud democrat then months ago."
Like the governor has begged Manchin to get on board with the economically liberal agenda. If we expelled him with the help of republicans I think we would get a more liberal democrat as a replacement and the Governor would agree to it because well his state needs the help.
"So I want to illustrate why this cancelling of student debt proposal is not the greatest idea:

\- We offer a windfall to some-18% of the population....18%.  This is not a large portion of the population

\- We are offering this to roughly 44.7M people and/or a total of $1.7T in student debt.

Lets assume that the full 100% of the estimated student debt isn't relieved but just a majority.  So we are going to add ANOTHER $1.25T to our national debt to relieve 18% of the population?  And we think this will ""save"" a lot of people and stimulate the economy?  $1.25T is pretty much what our first infrastructure package was to help THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, this helps 18%.

This needs to start by addressing the problem first.  Student loan originators and the schools themselves need to be put into check first and foremost, I want to illustrate with a personal story I had the pleasure of going through with a close friend of mine.

I wanted to help a friend of mine deal with one of these student loan entities, Navient which is one of the larger ones.  Scenario was they had to go into bankruptcy for a completely unrelated reason to student loans back in 2012.  Once he came out of the bankruptcy this loan popped back up on his radar and it was actually a loan he took out for his daughters college schooling.  He shared all the info with me and it is unbelievable the liberties Navient took upon themselves during this time.  It actually stated on the invoice/bill to them directly under the ""Interest Rate"" line item that ""Interest rates on private loans are set by the lender"" so it was set to 11.75%.....are you goddamn fucking for real?  So you just get to set whatever fucking rate you want to?!  Man, I should go out and be a student loan broker....holy fucking shit.  So after I found this out I figured we would be able to call them and negotiate a lower principal buydown if we paid everything right now....as most collection agencies work.  NOPE!  No leniency, he needs to pay it in full either now or later....it doesn't matter we just need the full amount with all interest.

This is all part of the bigger problem.  Schools jack up their rates because they know any kid will get approved for an educational loan because, well fuck, the banks know ""we want the US to get more educated so we will approve anything and the federal loan process allows us to collect from them till the day they die so here, take $200K, we know we will get it back."".  It's a fucking self fulfilling prophecy that, for some reason, the feds back the banks making sure this albatross will be around their necks forever AND they can dictate what the interest rate will be?   

I get that I am illustrating the whole point some people believe why relieving student debt is a must but it's not the right way to do this.  Fix the systemic problem first otherwise it will continue down this path and help nobody.  People who were willing to take out a loan like this should still be responsible for the loan, they agreed to the more simple terms of knowing you were taking out a large amount money to pay for education.  If we want to look at rolling back the clock and putting a cap on the interest rate, that makes sense and I could get behind that but just throwing \~$1.25T at this problem seems frivolous.  I hear people on the very posts about canceling student debt talking about how they would, in turn, go buy a car and a house entering into another form of loan/debt.  If you were willing to enter into a student loan over your head to begin with I don't have a ton of faith those same people will go buy a house or car within their means and large defaults on loans absolutely does not stimulate the economy.  There just needs to be some sort of level of accountability from all levels; loanors, loanees and the educational instituation.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant, it kind of is but I wanted to justify my thoughts behind it and hear others thoughts as well."

To those that know nothing about economics. I suggest you read up about it. Oh, as for those high prices. You can thank the corporations for

"Is this trolls, or is this from bernie? Tons of liberals like bernie but this doesn't seem like good strategy. 

Seems like we should be attacking trump, not.. potential voters?"
"I supported Bernie in 2016 wholeheartedly. I thought it was a mistake to support Hillary because the right (and Russia) had a big campaign against her that was working very well. I feel the same way this time around. I was in groups with a lot of older Dems telling them how dangerous it is to support Biden in the primary for the sole reason that so many young voters would turn their backs on the political process, not just in this year's election but for many elections to come. I was trying my hardest to make them see how harmful that could be. And now I'm in groups with mostly young voters, trying to make *them* see the dangers of sitting out in November. Of walking away from the party completely. I've been called many names and a lot of my posts have been taken down in all of these groups. And I can't help but think of Dr. Seuss' The Zax lol. I believe in Bernie, I believe in his policies and his vision. But I am definitely ""blue no matter who"" ~~with some limitations.~~

Why? Because I personally have a lot to lose with 4 more years of Trump. With quite possibly his third Supreme Court appointment. In his first two years in office I saw him chipping away at things that will impact **me.** And I know there are so many Americans that stand to lose way more! But everywhere I look, many Bernie supporters are not seeing that. They're not seeing the hard fought rights that can easily be stripped away. They're not thinking of the vulnerable people that will undoubtedly be hurt.

The virus has made it even clearer to me. So many people are talking about how this is a great time for workers to strike. Are they not understanding that so many people are losing their jobs right now? This will bring us into recession. Millions of people will be out of work, out of money, there's no way a mass strike could get off the ground with so many people desperate for work.

Dare I say the word guys, but it's a big neon sign flashing **privilege.** If I had a dollar for every straight, white, man that told me ""we have nothing to lose! #neverBiden"" I'd have enough money to justify voting red! You may ~~think you~~ have nothing to lose by sitting out in November. But please consider that the country is full of people who are so very painfully aware of what is at stake for them."
" me and my wife are talking about how we don’t have a good blue collar dem persona media presence, on top of we don’t have a strong enough media presence period.

I’ve considered making a pod cast I’m a 6’2” weight lifting blue collar center left voter that lives in the south. If we want success our message needs to be delivered by common hard working Americans.

That said there’s nothing wrong with progressive types but people like destiny make us look weak and blue collar folks can’t relate.

(I like destiny and think he’s well spoken I just think I learned a lesson this election image matters as much as content) 

I’d personally love to do a pod debate against the likes of charley Kirk and nick fuentez to show people you can protect women and minority rights and keep your “masculinity”. My physical contrast would be the starters my increasing knowledge on most subject matter would make me a threat to them not to mention Ive heard all their talking points as well as I listen to republican radio everyday so I know them better than they know themselves almost.

Idk I’m just really fucking pissed at this turn out and am thinking of action I can personally take"
"Bernie is next to last on my list of candidates that I would vote for in the primary. I really don't like the guy at all, especially for how he passively-aggressively sabotaged 2016. But the #1 priority is to defeat Trump. It's pretty clear he has the momentum and I think we need to coalesce behind someone sooner rather than later.

It sickens me to have to say this.

What say you?"
"Wanted to post in r/politics but I think the content type would be disallowed. I am a big fan of Buttigieg and would love to see him in the Oval Office, but I have doubts that the party would bestow him the nomination. So over the last several weeks, I’ve been thinking that a Biden/Buttigieg ticket would be a really great option. Biden bringing a plethora of political experience, a level head and win-ability with Buttigieg bringing strong intelligence, a military background, fresh ideas, and relatability to a younger generation. What do you all think?"
"As long as Democratic leaders can use this tactic to get votes. They're just take liberal and progressive voters for granted. As they move further and further to the Right becoming another party of Big Business, of the Wealthy as they stay just a little left of the Republicans on social issues.

I showed up a [townhall meeting](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jjycm/i_just_vented_my_frustration_to_keith_ellison_d/) of my Representative, Keith Ellison (D) co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, and told him I won't vote for Republican-lite policies disguised as Democratic ones.

We cannot continue to enable the Democratic party. We need to show them we're not afraid of a Republican administration. We survived 8 years of Bush, we can survive 4 years of Romney. And then in 2016 we can put out a real progressive candidate."

Personally, I'm independent, but lean left, especially for personal rights and the right to choose.

The ''republicans'' are only going along with it since they do not have the numbers to stop it.

If you do not believe me think about this, if the ''republicans'' were the ones with the power would they be doing any of this or would they kill it all.

No, they would not give two shits about any of it.

Just look at 2017- Jan 2021 to get your answer."
"Everyday I see tons of posts about how bad and dangerous Trump is. About his lies and his excesses. My feed is filled with those. Unfortunately I seldom read anything about Biden or Harris or about their program. It's the same pattern as previous election : democrat campaign built around the rejection of Trump. However it is as no lessons were learnt : trump thrives in the spotline. Any publicity is good publicity as they say and trump is a master of that. If the Democrats and the voters continue to play this anti trump card, They WILL LOSE. A better strategy is to forget talking about trump and try to emulate the Obama campaign which was built around a project and new ideas."

"Most of the polls I see these days say Biden somewhere around 35% with Sanders and Warren each around 15%

Which is odd, because until these polls started dropping a few weeks ago, I didn't even know Biden was running. I still haven't seen any articles talking about his policy, meanwhile Sanders and Warren are all over the news, all over the campaign trail and all over discussions. Just going by what I hear, the democratic primary is a 2-way fight between Sanders and Warren with Beto somewhere off in the corner not running for senate again where he has a reasonable chance of actually doing something amazing. But there's another candidate nobody's ever heard of who's actually somehow winning.

How does a silent candidate garner more than both their popularity combined?

It feels a lot like Clinton last election. Everything I ever saw was about Bernie, but she silently won the majority."
"I am a Senator Sanders supporter while Senator Warren is my second choice. My preference for the former over the latter is consistency of record. I recognize, however, that the supporters of each candidate do not necessarily prioritize the same issues. Given that a popular media narrative is that both candidates are ""the same"", I'm interested in responses of Senator Warren's supporters to the following questions.

1. Why did Elizabeth vote for Ronald Reagan? How does she reconcile this with her view that Washington started to get foreign policy wrong ""beginning in the 1980's""? Does this further imply that she supported the invasion of Vietnam?

3. Does Elizabeth still believe, as she stated in 2012, that ""all options are on the table"" with respect to Iran?
4. Why is Medicare for All noticeably absent on the issues section of her campaign website? [https://elizabethwarren.com/issues/](https://elizabethwarren.com/issues/)"
I'm 50/50 and I would like to know why I should become one? I'm pro-life and I don't support LGBT. The reason why I'm asking this is because my sister has a degree in political science and she's a democrat.
"Especially O'Malley and Chaffee. If you look at my post history, it's clear I support Sanders. I've tried to like Clinton but while there are some aspects about her I can appreciate, the more I hear from more, the more see through her act is. However I feel that any of the other people who were running for the democratic office wouldn't have been bad for president. Hopefully some of them will run again next election cycle."
"All issues of electability aside, is there a legitimate reason that Sanders SHOULDN'T be in the White House, over any of the other candidates? I have heard literally nothing bad about this guy."
"Having watched the first debate and last night's forum, in my belief Sanders scrubbed the floor with Hil-bot. Every time he spoke, his level of frankness, honesty, sensibility, and compassion made Clintron9000 look like a back-peddling, self-serving fool. I honestly don't understand how/why the Media keeps reporting that the former Circuitry of State (OK, that's enough) is still so far in the lead."
I saw online that I could check to make sure my ballot was counted. When I put in my information the only option is to request an absentee ballot. Is there a way to confirm that my ballot was counted?
"This smacks of Drumph style campaign fund solicitation. Don't question my party affiliation, random number!"
"I posted this on r/conservative but I wanted opinions from here as well.

I want to start off saying I’m a moderate republican. If you want to discredit what I have to say on that basis alone then you can downvote and just leave. 

Second, I want to say Reddit is an echo chamber for left wing ideology. However, THATS OK! People with similar views and demographics tend to amalgamate. I am not hating on Reddit because it has a strong left bias. If anything, it’s healthy for people to discuss politics in an open online forum. 

What isn’t healthy is to completely disregard, hate, and repulse anybody with an opposite view to yours. I find myself here after seeing another “Dear ____ Supporters, Why?” On ask Reddit. At first glance it’s perfectly fine to ask people why they support a candidate you find unappealing. By hearing another sides argument you can build upon your own political beliefs or alter your beliefs with newfound information. 

(I want to acknowledge other posts that use different language, topics, and motives but I’m using the above as an example)

But these types of posts don’t attempt to do any of the above. Rather, it becomes a karma farm for those who provide nothing to the conversation. Almost all the highest rated comments are usually something along the lines “because I’m stupid”, “Because I hate America”, “Because I don’t understand politics lololol”, etc. 

Those who do provide real reasons for their support are downvoted into oblivion. Why would you ask for opinions you already don’t agree with, then downvote them because you disagree? It completely boggles and infuriates me beyond belief. Reddit has become as bad right-wing racist Facebook moms. 

As a final word, I’m tired of seeing comments in R/politics claiming that people on Reddit (only the ones they agree with btw) are the last citizens fighting for democracy and justice. Stop kidding yourself. Such debates and hissy fits have occurred over the same reasons, over the same types of people, over the same “bullshit political system”, over the past 300 fucking years. 

The only thing you achieve reading the same biased articles, the same biased comments, the same biased opinions, is you become just as partisan as racist Trump voters. Get out and talk to those who have differing views from yourself. Find out why YOU support Sanders, Bloomberg, Biden, Trump, Warren, etc. Don’t let redditors decide for you.

Maybe I should just stay off R/politics lol

I’m sorry for any grammatical issues, I’m typing this on my phone at the gym. Sorry for bad formatting, I’m pissed and tilted.

"I have seen so many different slogans this year. Just to name a few off the top of my head:
- Make America Great Again
- Take America Back
- Save America
- Save America Again
- Keep America Great
- Never Surrender

What’s their official slogan, if they have one? And is Harris/Walz officially using “We are not going back”? "
"This is the weakness of the Democrats, we aren't striking at the most weakest position of the Republican Party.  I don't know what that could be, but some moves like supporting the Liz Chaneys', Mitt Romney, Kinzinger to give them influence and collaboration status with the current administration.  Mind funckin the Republicans so as to ADD more chaos and doubt within their ranks.  Weakening their house by torpedoing those Republican cancers like Kevin McCarthy, Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Green, Lauren Boebert, etc.

Democrats need to help by growing the chaos, so this new Republican theme can be diluted to minimize their significance.  This would be a Democratic investment.  Democrats needs to read, ""The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"" and maybe we'll be able to prevent tRump-like characters coming into power.

"My reply to a Maga friend name calling of Harris.  I  wanted to reframe their positions in language that they understand:

All the name-calling is childish,  and belongs on the elementary school playground. Let's talk policy:

If you want to force chix on welfare to have their kids, and put them on welfare too....if you want more people on welfare, vote Trump.

If you want it as easy as possible for chix on welfare to get rid of their kids....if you want less people on welfare,  vote Harris. 

If you want to make it difficult for gang members and criminals to get handguns, without affecting the ability of law abiding citizens to do so, vote Harris. 

If you want to make it easy for gang members and criminals to get handguns, vote Trump. 

If you want an attempt at balancing our out of control national budget, vote Harris.

If you want tax cuts for businesses, and no attempt at controlling our out of control national budget, vote Trump.

This next bit will be difficult, because the average voter doesn't understand economics: Immigration.

White chix aren't having enough kids to make up for the deaths happening.  

So if you want to completely cut off Immigration and put our economy into long term collapse, vote Trump. 

If you want to control Immigration, but keep those poor immigrants coming to make up for lack of births here, AND to do the grunt jobs that Americans don't want to do, vote Harris. "
