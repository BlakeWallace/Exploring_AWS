"So obviously as the title reads, I am a democrat and I've been reading the posts you guys put up here. With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my ""enemy"". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I would like to say that the overwhelmingly large amount of positivity in the comments is great to see. Also, I know it's not a lot of upvotes so far but it's the most I've ever received on Reddit so thank you all so much.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future. "

Just thought i'd point that out due to the overwhelming democratic presence / control over major political subreddits! Maybe we are the silent majority after all.
"Remember, a MAGA hat is worth nothing unless it has an ‚ÄúI voted‚Äù sticker on it"
"As I reminded myself this is the same media from 2001 that convinced their own people it was okay to bomb and completely destabilize the Middle East ‚Äúbecause they had ISIS‚Äù, I decided to open my mind.

I attended BOTH rallies, Trump‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs and needless to say, my mind was blown when I went to Trump‚Äôs. I never experienced such a magnitude of patriotism and unity. Numerous black people and other POCs were there, the majority of mainstream news would never show that. They looked happy and they were being treated equally from what I saw. People didn‚Äôt even treat them like black people, they were regular people like all other people. The primary message of the rally was to make our country better and the vibes were nothing but positive and energetic. In comparison, Biden‚Äôs rally was all about why Trump is a bad president and the energy was absolutely negative. People were angry and bitter, looking as if they were ready to beat up whoever expressed their support for Trump. This opened my eyes and made me realize where the hatred is truly coming from. As a longtime Democrat, I will be voting for Trump. We must start improving our country through unity, love, and positivity, which is completely opposite from what Democrats want at the moment.

Edit 1: clarification: what I mean by ‚ÄúPeople didn‚Äôt treat them like black people‚Äù is that they did not intentionally sympathize and treat them like victims just because they were black. They treated them like all other people regardless of the skin color. Sorry, English isn‚Äôt my first language and the wording could have been better.

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the awards! Never had an award before. :) This kind of outcome is not what I expected, let‚Äôs continue to stay united!

Edit 3: if you reported this post or feel the need to report, I strongly encourage you to open your mind and attend BOTH events instead of having all your thoughts formed by the mainstream news. Ability to keep your mind open and listen to both sides through unbiased lens is an extremely vital skill to have nowadays. If you still don‚Äôt agree with me, I still love you and will never treat you differently solely because of your political stance. Cheers!"

These racist claims seem to me just a way to open the door for voter fraud. Voter ID is normal everywhere. Who in the right mind could oppose that?
I just can't take the news media and their endless rabid hate for the administration plus a whole bunch of attempts to silence the Right. I don't consider myself a conservative but I can't vote for the Democrats anymore because they've gone off the deep end. Never thought I'd see this day but my old party is making me very nervous. Very.
"Women on the left have been blasting this narrative that a Trump victory is a threat to women‚Äôs rights. The only ‚Äúright‚Äù they‚Äôve indicated being taken away is abortion, which clearly isn‚Äôt an issue that the president will even have to address. 

The whole message is that if you vote for Trump you don‚Äôt care about women. But as a woman who has a daughter I feel like I HAD to vote Trump to protect rights she has that are much bigger than abortion. Her right to free speech, her right to assemble, to protest, her right to exist as a female in exclusively female spaces like sports and restrooms, to bear arms, her right to a secure border and safe streets, her right to not have gender confusion or mutilation pushed onto her, her right to be educated and raised by her parents and not the government. Most importantly her right to be an innocent child. 

Is there something I‚Äôm missing? "
"Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

Edit: Thank you for 1k upvotes. It feels great to know that people actually agreed with this."

"üö®BREAKING: President Trump plans to make Election Day a national holiday, implement single-day voting, paper ballots, and government-issued voter ID .. WHAT AN AMAZING CHRISTMAS PRESENT!"
"Hey guys,

im sitting over here in Europe (Italy) and I am just amazed how the media changed it's attitude towards the US in a matter of days!

The last 4 years they didnt write anything good about the US, about President Trump or about the Republican Party. And on inauguration day there were like hundrets of articles how good this is for the world, how Biden is the saviour of western civilization and that all Problems will be gone soon.

Where did investigative journalism go? The whole media apparatus is purely political nowdays. They dont care about the Hunter Biden story for example but as soon as Trump misspells a word they go craaazy.

The media is acting like a child who finally got their toy they wanted for so long.

It is disgusting! And the sad thing is we cant do nothing about it.

The media is the real Enemy of the 21st century! Not just in the US, but in the entire world!

PS: sorry for my rant... just wanted to let off some steam"
"I need somewhere to share this because I can‚Äôt do it to my liberal family or friends but I‚Äôve finally become a republican. The past four years and surrounding uproar throughout and after the election has made me realise how flawed and straight up wrong the Democratic Party is. I had been brainwashed by my Californian surroundings that trump was pure evil but really when you take out that left bias, it‚Äôs clear he made America great again. I regret not voting for him and being blind and robotic with my vote. I know from now I‚Äôll be red politically and keep frankly I‚Äôm ashamed to have been brainwashed for so long but thankfully I can stand here and say I‚Äôm a republican."

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"It's honestly baffling that reddit would treat you like this.

Welcome to r/Republican."
"I was just scrolling through my feed and keep seeing post after post after post about ""Elon is a Nazi and Trump has made me lose faith in America."" This is literally the only subreddit I'm in for politics, but nope left wing ideas will be pushed no matter where I look now. I am just so tired of it.. I used to look at reddit for memes but now all people post is just some dumb bs about Trump or Elon. Im just glad Trump won and is able to actually get some stuff done while we have the house and senate. I just wanted to post this somewhere I know I wouldn't just get banned immediately.

"I'm a Malaysian, Muslim male. I know,maybe we can't see eye to eye, I know you may have assumptions about me and my religion. All I can say about that is I understand why you have those thoughts, I do too, my Catholic filipino family probably does too but thank God they love me. All I want to say is, the left always talk about love and peace, but they continue to show hypocrisy and demonize anyone in disagreement with them. I've seen too much violence coming from them, too much hate and illogical points. All I see in the right is people protecting american values, I don't see racism, I don't see hate. PragerU was probably my convincing point. So if I was to choose a friend, I'd choose a right wing person, just because they won't continue to shove their ideas down my throat and force me to think like them. I know we don't see eye to eye, were both ignorant, I hope we can accept that and accept each other while respecting each others values. Peace be upon you."
"Just wanted to put this here to remind y‚Äôall of this, I saw a post on the Pennsylvania sub calling for respect between us all and they got called a pedophile for supporting the winning candidate.

"Hey guys. I am Black, a teacher, a gun owner and a Christian . I got into reddit for the memes and I quickly realized that reddit is a crazy leftwing echo chamber. People post crazy leftist (wrong) information and will downvote or ban anyone who happens to have a different opinion. I have no karma because I refuse to buy into the crazy. I just wanted to post here in hopes I can get rolling. Epstein didn't kill himself, corona came from china and is not as bad as the msm wants us to think, an unborn baby is a life on its own, if you want health insurance work for it. No one owes you anything, no matter how many likes you get.


Edit: Hello my leftist friends. I am a nerd and love Star Trek. Anyone who does not think socialism is a wonderful idea is selfish or just an ass hole. But people are shitty. Not all of them , but most of them. So it will not work because of that. I get it. I left college super brain washed and worked construction for a long time. The whole time I felt cheated because I was doing all the work and the company owner was making the money. ""Nobody cares. Work harder"". What I didn't understand is that the owner also works hard, and was there first. I started working harder and now am in a good place in life. So please before you try to sell me some "" My sales tax on gum is the reason you can have anything"" please understand I have been there. Again ""Nobody Cares. Work Harder"""
"I‚Äôve been quiet this election, not wanting to rock the boat. But since it‚Äôs Election Day. I‚Äôm gonna ask you - if you‚Äôre voting for a candidate who didn‚Äôt even have a primary election because you have a gay or transgender friend of family member, and you ‚Äúcare about their interests,‚Äù as a gay man diagnosed with gender dysphoria here are my interests:

-A secure border
- An end to funding wars 
-The protection of human life at all stages from from conception to natural death
- The protection of children from a billion dollar industry that wants to mutilate their bodies before they turn 18
- The protection of femboys and Tom boys who would grow up in any other age to just be gay or gender non conforming
- The right to 100% free speech - freedom of speech IS freedom from consequences from the government 
- The right to have the first female  president win because she is better than any man in power - not because she is a DEI
- The protection of women from men invading their spaces
- The protection from the state forcing a sh0t onto me
- The protection of my religion (Christianity) from an atheist death cult 
- The protection of ill√©gal migrant children and innocent refugees (make them citizens, not slaves)
- The continued criminalization of mind altering drugs 
- The protection from sterilizing children who aren‚Äôt trusted to drink or vote or get a tattoo, but for some reason can destroy their bodies 
- The right to ‚Äújust be gay‚Äù 
- The protection from erasure of the homosexual and lesbian communities by the alphabet mafia who seek to redefine what gay is 
- The protection from transgender people from military service 

Trump didn‚Äôt get rid of gay marriage back in 2016, when he had a Republican super majority. He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting. So if you‚Äôre voting today (which I beg you to do) because you ‚Äúcare about the interests‚Äù of your gay friends and family? Well I‚Äôm gay, and here‚Äôs my interests.

"I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? ‚ÄúNational pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.‚Äù ‚Äï Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election."

I thought the word ‚Äúnormal‚Äù had been cancelled by the woke left. I was publicly scorned 2 years ago for using the word  ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to describe someone who wasn‚Äôt suffering from a psychotic break.  

This person who publicly scorned me considers themself an oppressed minority. This person is a white female, attended an elite nyc private high school and Ivy League schools, inherited millions of dollars from their parents and identify as ‚Äúthey‚Äù. I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out how they are oppressed.  Much like I can‚Äôt figure out who the hell is allowed to use the word ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

The hypocrisy of the woke left. The self serving decisions. Those are the things that kill me a little bit inside.

I am not one to promote any particular commentator on here and I want you, my fellow Republicans, to determine for yourselves what is and is not important to us rather than the left telling us what is important, other countries telling us what is important, or any particular faction within the Republican party. I believe YOU decide what is important.

But there is one thing I think is crucially important that so many of us here (including myself at times) miss, and that is thinking about things more historically and more the way an artist might understand the flow of history. We need the nitty gritty, we need details, we need to look at the laws, the treaties, the minor incursions... we need to zoom into history with a microscope and view all those smaller (though serious and important) details.

But we also need to pull ourselves back and view history from a broader perspective. If you are a Christian who is familiar with Biblical history (and I encourage you all to be), one thing you will see is the ebb and flow of evil and good through time. When you see history this way, you can often see what is coming and be amazed as the details fill in towards that end. So very often this has brought the proper context to help me understand moments like the oval office meeting with Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy.

I think this particular episode of Andrew Klavan's show is so critically important because it contextualizes that event in a way that connects to history so easily, that you will understand the impact of it.

His argument (which I would go as far as to say is simply true) is that just like in WWII, we are in a world with a growing and serious existential threat. While Russia is undoubtedly bad, they have shown us historically that they are not the world domination type. Nor are we. We want to be sovereign to ourselves, and we are willing to compete, and we are willing to dominate markets and territories insofar as we need to to ensure we have the ability to be self sovereign in the face of threats like Russia and China. Russia is largely the same as us, they just do so in a messed up way as compared to us (obviously we are not perfect at this). China is not. China at this point in history wants domination of everything. They are self-sovereign, but they want more.

Russia always strikes me as Cain-like and we are more like Abel, and they are more Esau-like to our Jacob. In the Esau and Jacob story, Jacob is righteous (though imperfect) but Esau is just this kind of angry kid who loses his birthright. For time, the descendants of Esau dominate the descendants of Jacob, but that reverses.

Russia will not be a vassal to China or anyone else. Trump knows this; Putin knows this - that in the face of China, we will need each other. That does not make us friends, that does not make us respect each other. But when China moves, if the US is defeated, then Russia will be, too. If when China moves, if Russia is defeated, it may be that we are defeated, too.

There are other countries at play. I think India will play an important role. But right now, if you look at what is happening with this historical perspective and what happened in WWII, it seems Trump is trying to help cool the tensions between Russia and Ukraine because Ukraine either doesn't see or doesn't care about the threat that China is. China is a worse threat than Russia is to Ukraine and Zelenskyy doesn't seem to see that.

So to those who hate how Trump and Vance handled this meeting, please consider this. China is coming, they are poised. It is possible we can legislate and make moves that will keep them at bay, but right now they are preparing for war. Do you want to appease them like the UK did with Germany? Or do you want a leader who recognizes this threat and is trying to help everyone take some time to prepare but ending what amounts to a little spat compared to what we could see in a third world war?"

"I am a huge Tesla fan specifically for its innovation and I think Elon is bright, but I can‚Äôt fully understand how Elon Musk became the vice president/president. I find America is now becoming like Russia and Asia where the billionaires blatantly rule society with an iron fist.

And what new industries they plan to create in order to offset the economic impact of firing thousands of workers. He seems to be positioning himself for dare I say it‚Ä¶.. presidency. And why is America now so concerned with South African politics but on President Trumps campaign he has stated multiple times that America would no longer be involved in other countries politics and seems to be keeping his word except for his new vice presidents homeland. I am pretty satisfied with some of Trumps changes but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this will not end well. And why are we kicking out illegal immigrants but granting only a white South African minority asylum that also happens to own 70% of private owned land. "
"The Libtards are at it again, the amount of people freaking out in this post is insane. They've also discovered new buzzwords, like ""king"" ""emperor"", and ""gestapo"". üôÑ"
"There was a recent Trump meme that many of you found distasteful while others saw it as him owning what the left calls him anyway. I don't particularly like the meme myself, but if they're going to call him a despot and if he is going to keep winning for us, then I don't see much of a problem with him owning that ""king"" title as a joke.

But that is not why I'm talking about this.

A user recently posted this meme in our sub. The user seems to likely be a troll who believes that Trump is literally involved in a billionaire coup to install a fascist government. This is a stupid take, it flies in the face of reality, though we should always be on the lookout for such things.

By the way, I was going to leave the meme up and just lock the thread, because looking through the user's history it was mostly benign, and then I found a comment that showed me who they were.

The user compared Trump to Smedley Butler who was involved in a planned coup of wealthy elites (including Prescott Bush - George H.W.'s Grandfather - this is true) to overthrow the government to install a fascist  government. Smedley would have been used to arrest the current government at the time (this was under FDR) and I believe he was supposed to be the dictator - What a name for a dictator, huh? He also railed against military involved overseas among other things. The comparison is quite faulty considering many things, like how so many billionaires are against Trump and for the Democrats. But the left, they hear ""billionaire"" and think evil immediately and then create conspiracies, and unfortunately there is some real history that acts as fodder for it. Look up ""Business Plot"". And while the history is likely distorted by the left, it is not untrue.

Anyway, the user posted that meme as a troll. I am disappointed to say that it worked.

While much of the thread was full of non-Americans, leftist, moderates who hate Trump, people who keep commenting in r/antiwork and r/democrats who will always come and start trouble, our own argued with each other with a vitriol that the left deserves, not our own.

There were two sides. Those who immediately trashed the president for this meme are the most noteworthy (but I'll get to the others). And by trashed, I mean those who completely decontextualized it, some with longer comments that were nicely written, and some that said little more than ""This is dangerous"". And this is coming from someone who is absolutely concerned about authoritarianism in any party.

There were also our own who sometimes feel like they are trolling with how ride-or-die they are for Trump. And this is coming from someone who fucking loves Trump right now, even looking past this meme and what I consider to be an error on his dealings with Ukraine recently.

Anyway, there was quite a bit of arguing between these two types of our own.

Now, the motive of trolls is not always simple. But regardless of their conscious goals, discord and fighting is the result. They either sow doubt in you as an individual or they encourage infighting with their tactics.

And what's worse is that they often use legitimate things that we *should* look at to do so. I don't know about you, but I would gladly talk about that meme rationally if a fellow Republican told me about it, but if some asshole troll throws it in my face, I'm not going to want to talk about it.

That is part of this, that is part of why trolls are such pieces of shit. We can have such conversations and should have such conversations, but on our own terms and when WE deem it a problem, because you know that they see many things as problems that are not.

**Be aware of these things**. This used to be known as subterfuge but now it is just normalized internet discourse. It's not okay. Temper your arguments, check suspicious activity, check your own use of logical fallacies (because these bad discourse habits are ingrained in most of us and we don't even think twice about it), and remain as civil as possible, especially when talking about hot button issues for us. The left is fractured now, they want us to fracture, too.

Lastly, it is a logical fallacy to disregard an argument based simply on the person who made it. That said, knowing who is making posts and comments and understanding their intent for bringing up their point is totally valid, especially when the user in question is just making a post and not necessarily commenting themselves, like in the case of the recent post. So when you see posts that piss you off, go ahead, look through the history of the user. I had to go pretty deep to find out about that user.

I will post a screen shot of the taken down post for your reference with the user's name blacked out (that is if I'm not too boomer-ish to do so... I still use old reddit pretty much all the time)."

What‚Äôs the point of Trump negotiating a peace treaty in Ukraine if he doesn‚Äôt plan on America doing anything in any case? You would assume if America‚Äôs negotiating we‚Äôd be somewhat involved be it with sending troops to help administer a neutral zone or to guarantee Ukraine post-war but Trump has stated he does not intend for America do either or increase aid for Ukraine if the deal fails. If this is the case why even bother negotiating if we‚Äôre not going to get involved no matter the outcome? For the sake of being world-police? Also why should Ukraine accept any deal they view unfavorable now if they know the U.S. won‚Äôt support them even if they did sign the deal and why would Russia accept a deal if they know America won‚Äôt aid Ukraine anymore even if they don‚Äôt end the war? I just don‚Äôt see any point in Trump negotiating if America doesn‚Äôt have any involvement on the outcome, either just pull out and let them deal with it or actually have America involve itself in the outcome.

"Reddit keeps telling me that Trump supporters have been regretting their vote for President Trump. Do you agree with Reddit or do you think Reddit has been brigaded with retard bots?

So far I been leaning towards the latter :/"
"I've been on board with cuts and investigation the Trump administration has been doing.. but I'm having a hard time understanding how this one is helpful. I'm heartily in favor of funding scientific research. This is limiting lab and equipment expenditures, a necessary part of that research. 

I'm not saying there aren't issues with the NIH that should be addressed. For one, there's loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public. Publicly funded research should be required to be published. But this isn't addressing that. 

If there's corruption, or conflict of interest issues, wouldn't requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution? And firing those that abuse it? Not this? 

If its that we don't want to waste money on pointless studies, wouldn't a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution?

The only other argument I've seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money. But do we know that, and if so, how? I've seen a couple of comments on YouTube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for. Not a very official source, I know -- where else can I look into that?

Does anyone have a good argument in favor of this?"
"We have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted. You'll have to excuse my boomerishness, but with New Reddit and some other changes (I still prefer Old Reddit) some of what we used to do has shifted. Some of these thing I think can be coded, but I am learning how. Again, forgive my ignorance.

Anyway, one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos, text posts, and image posts, if unchecked, were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us, but also intended to get us shut down. If some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we weren't diligent enough in taking them down, the sub could get shut down. 

That is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception, and it remained an unspoken rule. But things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made, and then new reddit happened and we mods just didn't adjust to the times perhaps? That's my excuse anyway.

People started posting links in text posts, which I thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it, but it was just a pain in the ass. They started posting text commentary under articles, which never used to happen.

So the issue is thus: too little oversight into posts leads to

* Shit posts (And I mean shit)
* Trolls having too easy a time to troll
* Bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users.

These new rules are to force commentary where it belongs, in the comment section. If you want to make a comment about your article, just make it in the comment section, don't change the title to comment on an article, and don't comment on the article in any body section (I think I changed that so you won't be able to).

**Forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the** ***same*** **commentary**. So do not complain about free speech on this front. Protestors have to follow rules, too, they are supposed to get permits, they are not allowed to just disrupt everything... at least anywhere other than blue cities.

This also prevents an annoying trend I've been seeing where users post a link to Google. Not a Google article. Not some app on Google to comment on the app in some relevant way, just posting a link to Google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post.

Hopefully I have removed that ability so the rule is moot.

We also hope to allow more things like text posts, video posts, and other posts. But that requires moderation. I can't tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll, brigade, and try to hurt us. An innocuous photo of Trump and the First Lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of Melania's dress or Trump's tie (I forget which). It was a troll post.

There may be setting changes to do some of this automatically (and I think there are, but I'm new to this part of moderating) so the rule doesn't even matter because it won't be possible to break these rules.

That said, I would also like you to know WHY we limit the kinds of posts we allow."
"Summary:  View help for Summary We tested the fixity of political preferences of 136 healthy males during the 2011 U.S. presidential election season by administering synthetic testosterone or placebo to participants who had identified the strength of their political affiliation. Before the testosterone treatment, we found that weakly affiliated Democrats had 19% higher basal testosterone than those who identified strongly with the party (p=0.015). When weakly affiliated Democrats received additional testosterone, the strength of their party fell by 12% (p=.01) and they reported 45% warmer feelings towards Republican candidates for president (p < 0.001).  Our results demonstrate that testosterone induces a ‚Äúred shift"" among weakly-affiliated Democrats.  This effect was associated with improved mood.  No effects were found of testosterone administration for strongly affiliated Democrats or strong or weak Republicans.  Our findings provide evidence that neuroactive hormones affect political preferences."
So I starting using Reddit like consistently a couple of months ago like right after the election and I was surprised to see just how liberal the app was. Like every general sub is literally just anti trump stuff and liberals melting down in every sub. Like even completely unrelated posts ppl in the comments will somehow bring trump up. Will this calm down at all over his term or are they gonna whine about this the whole time?

Turns out just firing people at random without much concern as to what they do is a really bad idea. 
"EDIT: Based on an heavily brigaded post that gained a record number of comments for our sub in just a few hours and some of the comments I saw there from people claiming they are Republicans (the brigade was largely from Europeans, Canadians, and the left though), I feel I need to put this back up. END EDIT.

I covered leftist talking points in the last announcements (and I'll take that down once it seems the leftists, trolls, and bots have abated for the time being), but I wanted to discuss what it means to break our anti-Republican rule, along with our Reagan's 11th Commandment rule... because they are basically the same rule.

I'm going to go through some common complaints we get from banned users and how to avoid being banned like those users.

-**I was just stating a fact. What, FACTS aren't allowed anymore??**

Facts are allowed. They have always been allowed and even encouraged. But if your fact is laced with commentary, then it is not longer ""just a fact"". Here are some examples.

* **Fact**: The sky is blue.

* **What gets you banned**: The sky is blue, you fucking fascist.

Take note, because many do not notice the subtle difference between these two comments. Many who write something similar to the second comment will frequently in modmail say ""I was just stating a fact!"" This is so common, it's not funny.

Here's another one:

* **Fact**: Musk and Trump are uncovering a lot of fraud. While mistakes are being made, they are also being corrected, and Musk only has the power to report findings, not make final decisions.

* **What will get you banned**: Musk and Trump, man... these guys are running amok. I'm deeply concerned about how Musk is just firing people.

Do you see the difference? One is a fact, one is commentary and kind of half fact and half untruth. Many users do not see the difference. Be a user who does.

-**Just because I don't suck Trump's dick means I'm anti-Republican! I have been registered Republican for [X number of] years!**

This is one we get a lot. You must understand that we are a large umbrella. There are MAGA Republicans. There are Trump supporters who love Trump for this time in history but want to see leadership arise that is a bit more conventional as a leader and a bit easier for moderates to swallow. There are Republicans who absolutely hate the current president and the direction of the party.

We don't care what category you fall under. What we care about is that you show deference to fellow party members.

If you don't like the memes of Trump, fine, but don't trash people who do. And if you think it makes us look bad, I would just point out that the left has called us racists and bigots for literally decades and we took it in stride. They memed us in the media constantly before memes were even a thing.The character assassination attempts they did to Trump, they also did to Romney, to McCain, to Bush Jr., to Bush Sr., they accused Clarence Thomas of rape just like Kavanaugh. This is the left's M.O. and it has been for longer than I've been alive, arguably since before the Civil War.

You don't have to like the memes President Trump posts or that we on the right are making and posting. I don't particularly like them myself. But to trash fellow Republicans for it, without giving any understanding to the fact that the left have memed us and called us racists and bigots for decades, is disrespectful to your fellow Republicans.

You can argue it makes us look bad. But do so with respect.

* **What's acceptable**: I don't like this meme and doesn't think it helps our cause, but I can see why people find it funny and find it to be a valid answer to what the left has done to us for decades.

* **What's not acceptable**: The MAGA's who suck Trump's dick love this shit, but it makes us look bad.

*I would say to all the users who worry about looking bad to the left*: I know you care about looking bad to the left, but how about looking bad to your fellow party? Comments like the one just above make YOU look bad to ME and many of your fellow Republicans.

Show respect.

-**[Insert Prominent Republican's Name] is a piece of shit! He's a traitor to the party!**

I am a Christian first, a member of my family second, an American third, and a Republican lower on the list. I hope all of your have a similar hierarchy. Political parties are not the be-all and end-all. 

Political parties are tools to pool votes in a coalition to create a platform that a large number of people with many varying views can get behind and vote for in the face of another party that is doing the same with views we largely disagree with. They have value in the situations, but I kind of hate that they exist.

That said, being a sub FOR the party (although we are not affiliated with the GOP in any official capacity, we are just fellow Republicans), we do need to show deference to the party, we need to respect the party, we need to respect the umbrella, and we need to respect the individuals in the party.

I am not a fan of Romney but I respect that he is a Republican. So if I criticize him, I might have a little fun, but I won't just trash him. **Keep in mind, would you rather the left win, or have a [insert Republican you don't like]?** In my case, I'd rather have a Romney than an Obama.

* **What is acceptable**: Romney doesn't feel all that Republican to me these days and I really don't like how he keeps breaking from Republicans on so many issues, to the point I'd call him a RINO. But he's a strong business man and I'd take him over Obama any day.

* **What is not**: Fuck that loser Romney. He's a RINO piece of shit. I don't trust him.

Do you see the difference? One way criticizes while showing solidarity with the party, the other way is making it difficult to have any solidarity because it's so disrespectful.

We need solidarity. That does not mean we accept ""traitors"" if indeed we have any, but that does mean that we do not treat our fellow Republicans like crap. We don't throw them to the wolves unless it is clear we must. We don't cast them aside unless the allegations against them are credible. If they are indeed a RINO, show the receipts, but be respectful.

Matt Gaetz is a prime example. The right thing to do was to cut ties with him, but not before allegations were credible enough (especially knowing the left has made so many false accusations before). And also it should be done with the understanding that a lot of senators and congressman of all parties have likely been in a similar situation but just haven't been caught. He shouldn't have done what he seems to have done and it's inexcusable, but it also seems like a political targeting. Both of those things can be true at the same time.

We don't jump down a Republican's throat at the first accusation of impropriety, we let the facts come out and then deal with it appropriately. Getting hysterical about it from the first moment would lead to us not having Clarence Thomas or Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. We wouldn't have Trump. And think about how many it worked on. It worked on Romney, it worked on Bork (look him up), it worked on so many others. This is the left's MO. They tried to get rid of Hegseth because of a tattoo and baby clothes. Don't buy their hysterics, let the facts come out.

I hope this clears things up."

"I can not understand how people aren't screaming to uncover more of this wasteful and sometimes fraudulent spending. Why are we not all, EVERY TAX PAYING CITIZEN, breaking down our local politician's doors (metaphorically), asking what they knew and whether they profited from this? We should be demanding answers on how this type of spending was allowed to go on for years and, in some cases, DECADES. Trump turned the spotlight on these corrupt politicians and they are scurrying around like the cockroaches that they are. Democrats and Republicans. WE DEMAND ANSWERS AND REPERCUSSIONS!!!!! Watergate was a grain of sand compared to this mountain of a scandal. The worst part is that so many are listening to the left's chants and falling for it when the evidence is right there in black and white!!!!!! We need to DEMAND that those responsible and/or complicit in this scandal are punished criminally and civilly. Ask why a politician making $174,000 a year becomes a multimillionaire in 5 years. Do not let them slither away without being held accountable!"

I am socially liberal and fiscally conservative I voted red in the last election and I will not be adding more on that. When I go into this community I feel like every comment section I see people spouting hate not even on just the democrat voters but on all of those who oppose our thinking in the political landscape. I don‚Äôt understand why we feel the need to do all of that I have seen some community members say downright repugnant stuff. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to work towards helping them see the error in their ways through calm and calculated discussion? Shouldn‚Äôt we try to put America first together? This level of animosity was not the norm before the 2010s I just don‚Äôt get why we need to keep at the arguments and yelling. Should we not try to get back to working with our fellow Americans if your family members were to have a different political party and ideals than you do how would you honestly react. I bet it wouldn‚Äôt be on par with the stuff I see on here. I would like to start a serious discussion about this.

Also this, ""Republicans aren't gonna vote because it's rigged"" thing seems like a perfect set up for ""Democrats won because Republicans refused to vote""... IF the election is stolen.

"1. The Inuits are not indigenous to Greenland.
2. 60,000 people on a block of ice cannot be a country.  That's the notion that is silly.  They are completely and totally reliant on Denmark and they will continue to be completely and totally reliant on some external power in the future.  The only question is what power.
3. Russia and China are trying to get their hooks into Greenland.  Denmark is not capable of stopping them.
4. Denmark is not capable of developing the vast resources of Greenland.
5. Thus, the control of Greenland becomes vitally important to the United States of America.
6. The 60,000 residents of Greenland would benefit from American control almost immeasurably.  They could be given a percentage of all recourses developed, just like in Alaska.  They could receive American citizenship, which would allow the possibility for immediate, unfettered migration to the US--a dream of billions across the globe.  The US is capable of providing economic development to the island that Denmark is not nearly capable of.  Sure, there's the idealistic dream of independence.  But through Door Number Two is an actual better life for the people--a much better life."
"So for the first time in my life I voted early. Primarily so I don't need to take time off on election day, but also because this is the most consequential election since 1860.

I know that gets thrown around a lot. But it's seemingly true in every way.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**‚Ñ¢** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

If you could share this with friends, family, people unsure about Trump, it would be greatly appreciated. I put a lot into this. Not **A LOT** but enough to be sad if no one ever sees it. Cheers."

"Please persuade me as to how Kamala Harris is a good pick for President. I say this not in an argumentative manner, but moreso because I cannot find many reasons that prove she is a good pick. 

I am a first generation American. I'm in love with the idea of the American dream. I feel as if my life is molded around it. Along with all the ups and downs, and boy my life has been one hellride so far, I wouldn't be the same without this dream. I see myself becoming who I want to be and I am obtaining tangibles and intangibles that I never would've had I not worked this hard.

Many see Trump as a villain. This guy is a new York made man. An example to look up to. I believe he is a true protector of the American dream. He could've taken whatever money he was inherited and fumbled. He could've went to the Colonial inn and drank it all away. To me, he should be an idol to all Americans, especially young. However mainstream stereotypes seem very true, my generation (I'm 26) is lazy and wants handouts for everything. Free water, free healthcare, free is not always free. 

Kamala is going to tax hard working Americans. I know that I am not alone when I say I don't want to be taxed more because people can't find it in themselves to be diligent and make something of themselves. If, and I can't believe I'm saying if, Kamala wins, we are doomed and the American Dream will certainly become a nightmare. "

"""50 protests 50 states 1 day ü§ìü§ì"". Wah, wah, wah. God bro why can't the Loser Left just get over it already. Trump won by a landslide, fair and square. It's crazy how the Dems are still angy about losing the election, literally almost 3 months ago. And yes I know they have the right to protest, but at the same time there's a time to just accept things for the way they are, and doubling down on the nonsense that lost them the election isn't gonna help one bit."
Idk about anyone else but this was the line I didn‚Äôt want to see get crossed‚Ä¶.now I‚Äôm worried. 
"For as long as I can really REMEMBER Republican Presidents (Reagan) ...the left has called them **Nazis.**

When Trump was elected, you said he was a *wanna be dictator.*  You said he was going to find a way to declare martial law and be President forever.  Some of you who say and said this were the same people who scoffed and (rightfully) laughed when some on the right claimed that Obama would do this.

So ... what have we seen in the USA since Trump was elected?  A constant invective of leftist pap from the commie boot-licking media.

Attempts to remove him from office.  Again and again.  

Claims that detention centers for illegal immigrants that have existed under numerous Presidents are now ""Nazi concentration camps.""

And see, we had a national emergency in Covid 19.  If he was going to declare martial law and overstep, that was the *perfect* opportunity to do it.  ""Why isn't he doing more,"" you said.  Because it is the right and responsibility of the state governors to deal with their respective states.  But he DID OFFER FEDERAL help to those who needed and requested it.

Covid did NOT make Trump into a tyrant.

So what came next?  Camera footage of the George Floyd arrest.

Most of America was horrified and agreed that the police bore responsibility for misuse of force ... (even though, apparently, that particular neck hold was accepted as a restraint method for someone resisting in a *number* of different states.)

We were fairly united in condemning that.

But then the left, BLM and Antifa took the opportunity to encourage and promote widespread destruction across the USA.  Destruction that didn't just ""burn property""...(though that in itself IS BAD) but took the lives of people and police and ruined businesses and created an environment that gave rise to a part of Washington state trying to declare itself to be a totally DIFFERENT autonomous country until they figured out that they couldn't do that (legally) and renamed themselves to a ""protest"" zone.  And people died there.

For days we watched as people tried to break down barriers around the White House.  The DC government appears to have abdicated their responsibility to keep the peace and seemed to stand down as 60 secret service agents were injured over the course of days of attacks against the White House and ***you thought it was funny*** that they might have been concerned enough at one point to put the President in the bunker.  You damned fools who think attacking the White House was good?  You have NO IDEA the defenses unconventional and otherwise that the White House has to debilitate your ass quickly.  These idiots legitimately thought that they were going to storm the White House and you acted like it was their right to do it because they were really mad about George Floyd.

**...a man who was killed in a Democrat run state in a democrat run city.**

We gathered what this was all about very quickly...and we watched ALL the livestreams of the protesting.  Yeah...we saw the one where the cop pulled a gun on a guy...and we ALSO KNOW that it happened because someone came up behind a police supervisor with a brick and smashed him over the head with it.

You ignored the destruction and riots in favor of a narrative of blaming the cops for reacting to SENSELESS riots.  Cops that were in mostly liberal cities run by Democrats.  Riot cops using riot techniques responded to riots and you did surprised Pikachu face.

It's been months now with this lawlessness happening and Trump has repeatedly told Democrat governments to get it under control.

But your Democrat governments failed you.  They decided that destruction of businesses sometimes created over the lifetime of black owners who cried in the streets after they were looted and burned...that lives lost..that packs roaming the streets bent on violence and anarchy... all of these were ACCEPTABLE...

...because it was making the President look bad.

He showed AMAZING restraint.  60 secret service members were injured and a church torched before Barr said that the perimeter around the White House should be moved back.

Months of violent protests.  Months.

And your Democrat leaders let you stew in it.  They abandoned their civilians and turned on their police.  You need to understand that they REFUSED to act appropriately and put many of you in real danger of harm because its an election year and these riots are ""bad for Trump.""

If it seemed like there was no one to protect you... it's because there was not...except the FEDERAL government and the governors kept telling Trump, ""Don't you dare.""  They refused to protect you and when Trump said, ""You need to restore order or I'm going to have to help your citizens..."" they said, ""Don't you dare.""

And he didn't dare.  He didn't declare martial law.  

He repeatedly asked the Democrat governments to stop the violence and protect the citizens.

And they didn't.  Because the destruction and bloodshed was acceptable because it made Trump look bad.  And the media carried their water.  There were not stories about how Democrat cities were failing to maintain law and order...there were stories about how these ""protests"" were justified.

...maybe they think it made Trump look weak... maybe they were trying to bait Trump into sending in help so that they could scream that he was a Nazi.

These protests are ""against fascism and police brutality"" you say!

***...So why the hell is the worst of it in Portland?***

Does Portland have a fascist government?  WTF are you even protesting there?  Portland is ""weird"".  Portland is antifa central.  You little shits harass innocent motorists there and the cops stand down.  Portland's NOT a fascist city.  But the trained Marxists of BLM and the violent anti-capitalist revolutionaries of antifa burned down the police union building, locked cops in a building and tried to burn it and are trying to burn a federal building.

**So now y'all got some federal attention.  And you've clutched your pearls to yell, ""Brownshirts!""**  

No... the BROWNSHIRTS are you little commie and otherwise criminal miscreants who have been making the streets unsafe across the USA for months.

MY GAWD...you called the Tea Party ""un-american terrorists""...but if they had pulled a QUARTER of the shit y'all have pulled...you would have had a POINT.

They pulled NONE OF IT.

**YOU ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS.**

You got naked women and alleged grandmas out there now for your human shield.  Are kids next?

And it's about time someone dealt with your FEDERAL crimes because your inept leftist leaders have put innocents in the way of violence over POLITICS.

Your cause is no longer just.

You need to stop doing violence.

Cowardly democrat leaders need to stop LETTING you get away with it.

Now the feds are in Portland.

**""They are unmarked brownshirts!""**

They ARE marked, but they don't look like your local officers, because they aren't. You have shown the kind of harm you mean to do to police who are identified.  You have already killed MARKED police officers.

When the unmarked mommy van pulls up and arrests you, I'm not thinking ""Fascism has come to America.""

I'm thinking, ""It's about FUCKING time.""

You complained about ""armed militias"" protesting the covid shutdown, [but yesterday an armed black militia member ""accidentally"" discharged a weapon and shot other protestors.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/members-armed-militia-shot-breonna-taylor-protest/story?id=71990031)

And you have the nerve to try to insist that we need to join you now in your protest because Trump has federal marshals on the streets?  Not just no...but HELL NO.

There's a dangerous virus out there.  We don't want it to spread."
He's right. She can capture the moderates that Trump can no longer after the Jan6 fiasco.
"Of Dems stealing election like 2020. I‚Äôm sure they have same plan in place in 3-4 key battleground states to see how many votes are needed and delay reporting until these are ‚Äòfound‚Äô.

"1. I voted Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon of gas at 15% isn't.

2. I voted Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.

3. I voted Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.

4. I voted Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves.

5. I voted Democrat because I believe that people who can't tell us if it will rain on Friday can tell us that the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don't start driving a Prius.

6. I voted Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive.

7. I voted Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away the social security from those who paid into it.

8. I voted Democrat because I believe that business should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrats see fit.

9. I voted Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit some fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.

10.I voted Democrat because I think that it's better to pay billions to people who hate us for their oil, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher or fish.

11. I voted Democrat because while we live in the greatest, most wonderful country in the world, I was promised ""HOPE AND CHANGE"".

12. I voted Democrat because my head is so firmly planted up my ass, it's unlikely that I'll ever have another point of view."
"It's common knowledge that since the election and inauguration, 90% of subs have become liberal circlejerk crybaby playpens. But I'm actually getting pissed off seeing comment after comment after comment after comment calling all Republicans ""fascist"", ""Nazis"", crying about the ""concentration camps"" or Elon's ""Nazi salute"", and so on. Liberals are literally the most sad and pathetic people on the planet, I genuinely hope some of them are trolling, because the other reality them being incredibly stupid, is terrifying. At this point maybe they *want* us to do all the stuff they say we do? Like some kind of weird fetish or something? I don't even know at this point...

That's really it, I just needed to blow off some steam somewhere where I won't get mass downvoted"
"First of all I want to say I am positing this here rather then /r/politics because I thik I more likely to get the discussion I want here then the obama zombie downvotes I would get there. Second I'm not going to start off saying weather or not I support gay marriage because I'm sick of people going ""I support gay marriage but..."" because they are afraid of the ridiculous reaction if they don't post that. You should be able to tell from what I'm writing.

First off, lets get one thing out of the way, Being gay has one big component and that is gay sex, if you don't have gay sex, you are just attracted to the same gender as yourself. I think a lot of people discount the ACT of gay sex in their discussions. It seems that it has been decreed as an ACTION that cannot be judged, which I find kind of ridiculous, but I will bring this point up again when I get to gay marriage.

Gay Kids are on the Front Line
I think the Gay Rights movement has put gay kids on the front line. Admittedly I think this would also happen without the gay rights movement, but I don't think the gay rights movement tries to shield gay kids, because it is not in their best political interest. There is a lot of emphasis put on coming out and being out and proud, and I think that is detrimental to some kids who just want to get through high school and move on to a community where they won't be treated like crap because they are the only ones who are different. I can see in some sense it may be a good idea to expose highschoolers to different sexualities early on for the sake of tolerance, but I think in most cases kids will be dicks until they mellow out around the age they get in to college. This is just a maturity thing. So in some cases there is no good reason for these ay kids to come out until college when there is a local community they can turn to. The counter point to this may be that kid who killed himself after his roommate tried to watch him having sex through a web cam. Perhaps if the room mate had been exposed to more gay people early on he wouldn't have done such a thing. Or he was just a dick who didn't like his room mate and would have tried to web cam him even if he brought a girl in to the room.

The Gay Hissy Fit
This is currently going on with Chick-Fil-A. When the country didn't overnight go ""Oh ok same sex marriage"" it seems a lot of people had really bad over the top reactions. Same Sex marriage is a HUGE social change. Marriage has mainly been between a man and a woman. Sure it has also mainly been a property transaction, a political move, a way to consolidate power, but even in those cases, it was between a man and a woman. (There is apparently some evidence of the very early church doing some kind of consecration of a same sex relationship, but it was more or less declaring the people to be brothers, not married) This isn't going to chance over night. There is nothing in the constitution about Same sex marriage because when you suggested to someone back then that two men might want to marry eachother, they would have looked at you funny. It was so obvious they they figured they didn't need to add anything about it. No, they didn't even figure. The over reactions to a differing opinion on the mater do not help the movement and in fact hurt it because it sets up a ""with us or against us"" situation. I think the issue of same sex marriage will be sorted out mainly with time, telling me I'm awful because I like Chick-Fil-A isn't going to help. The violent reactions to the people that supported Prop 8 probably just justified their donations in their eyes.

Same Sex Marriage
I just want to try and spell out what I think the problem people have with same sex marriage. The biblical passage basically point out that the ACT of gay sex is wrong. So people who believe it find gay sex to be immoral. Basically if you don't think gay sex is immoral you should have no problem with same sex marriage, plain and simple. However if you do find it immoral, you are going to have an issue with an official recognition of a relationship where that action occurs because it is forcing something on you, from your perspective. This is the only example I could think up that works I think. So some people like Dominant submissive sexual situations, maybe they take it so far that s that s lives as a slave with D. In their home s is D's slave. D and s decide that they want the world to treat them how they act inside their home, so they go to court and say they want a slave marriage where s is officially declared the slave of D, and s is officially property. A judge finally goes, well you are two consenting adults, and if s really wants it I will declare that s if officially property that belongs to D. So now everybody has to treat s as property, if s works a job his/her wages have to go in to Ds account because s is property and can't have a bank account, if s is seen driving around without D, the police have to bring s back to Ds house and so on and so forth. Some people might find that they don't want to do this because they think treating people as property as wrong and don't want the courts to tell them ""too bad, this is what they want"" so they then go ahead and try to make Slave marriage illegal. I'm pretty sure it breaks down because the Constitution expressly forbids slavery, but you get the idea. I think there is a lot of dicussion that doesn't happen because the gay rights movement just labels people as bigots and full of hate and that just hardens their hearts against gay rights and gay families. I don't have a solution for what they should be doing, but I don't certain things are working.

So any thoughts? Am I an awful horrible person? Am I wrong about any of this?"
"I never dreamed that I would have to face the prospect of not living in the United States of America, at least not the one I have known all my life. I have never wished to live anywhere else. This is my home and I was privileged to be born here.

But today I woke up and as I had my morning coffee, I realized that everything is about to change. No matter how I vote, no matter what I say, something evil has invaded our nation, and our lives are never going to be the same.

I have been confused by the hostility of family and friends. I look at people I have known all my life--so hate-filled that they agree with opinions they would never express as their own. I think that I may well have entered the Twilight Zone.

You can't justify this insanity. We have become a nation that has lost its collective mind!

‚Ä¢ Somehow it‚Äôs un-American for the census to count how many Americans are in America.

‚Ä¢ Russians influencing our elections are bad, but illegals voting in our elections are good.

‚Ä¢ It was cool for Joe Biden to ""blackmail"" the President of Ukraine, but it‚Äôs an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquires about it.

‚Ä¢ Twenty is too young to drink a beer, but eighteen is old enough to vote.

‚Ä¢ People who have never owned slaves should pay slavery reparations to people who have never been slaves.

‚Ä¢ People who have never been to college should pay the debts of college students who took out huge loans for their degrees.

‚Ä¢ Immigrants with tuberculosis and polio are welcome, but you‚Äôd better be able to prove your dog is vaccinated.

* Irish doctors and German engineers who want to immigrate to the US must go through a rigorous vetting process, but anyone who jumps the southern fence illegally is welcome.

‚Ä¢ $5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for ‚Äúfree‚Äù health care is not.

* If you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.

‚Ä¢ People who say there is no such thing as gender are demanding a female President.

‚Ä¢ We see other countries going Socialist and collapsing, but it seems like a great plan to us.

‚Ä¢ Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.

‚Ä¢ Criminals are caught-and-released to hurt more people, but stopping them is bad because it's a violation of THEIR rights.

‚Ä¢ And pointing out all this hypocrisy somehow makes us ""racists""?!

Nothing makes sense anymore, no values, no morals, no civility and people are dying of a Chinese virus, but it racist to refer to it as Chinese even though it began in China.
We are clearly living in an upside down world where right is wrong and wrong is right, where moral is immoral and immoral is moral, where good is evil and evil is good.

Wake up America, the great unsinkable ship Titanic America has hit an iceberg, is taking on water, and is sinking fast. The choice is yours to make. What will it be? Time is short, make your choice wisely!

"I've seen countless ""Trump promised to lower taxes day 1! Gotcha!"" posts, and maybe I'm in the minority here, but I dont think anyone but the left thought Trump literally meant the first 24 hours of his presidency.

Anyone with a functioning brain understands that to bring prices down, it's going to take time. It is not within the president's power to regulate our economy. We can introduce bills and regulations, but the president cannot do it alone.

It seems like, over the last few years, I've seen plenty of left leaning people take words literally and at face value. I could say, ""I've been so stressed out at work, I feel like I just want to jump off the roof!"" and there response would be, ""Don't jump off the roof! People want you here!"" When that wasn't the point of my statement at all.

Just thought I'd post this and see if anyone else has noticed this?I would love to hear other examples of this as well."

For many, Republicanism has morphed into Trumpism, which I will never align with. I accept that the support for a single person within the party is unprecedented, but so is the number of Republicans who reject him, including quite a few of his senior advisers.

So, this is a place for ""Republicans to discuss issues with other Republicans"". What does it mean to be a Republican in the age of Trump. Is there a Trump litmus test?"
"This is not a troll. This is not an insult to feel bigger and better than you. This is simply telling you that your behavior is pathetic. This is reminding you that you know, we know, and everyone knows your behavior is pathetic. And we are imploring you to choose better for your own sake. 

Sure, it would be nice if you didn't whine at us, but we are so used to it because you've been acting this way for 40 years or so that now we don't give a shit. We don't give a shit if you troll us, we don't give a shit if you think we're idiots, we don't give a shit if you brought some new fact you think we haven't heard... we don't care what you think of us anymore because we don't care what pathetic losers without an ounce of credibility think. You shouldn't either, we have some among our ranks, too... but you folks are a special breed.

There are many admirable people on the left, but you butthurt folks coming to troll on a day like today are not among them. You could be, but you are not. You are pathetic, overly emotional losers.

You could be doing something to better yourself right now, you could be trying to find a way to make this country better despite what you think has been a turn for the worse, but you are here lashing out because you're too lazy, too selfish, too self-involved, too comfortable to actually make an effort and do something better.

I presume you want better for yourself than that. I hope you want better for yourself than that and that you are just here in a moment of weakness, but that's not the vibe I get.

You know what I did when Biden was inaugurated? I lived my life. We all knew he was the worst choice this country has ever made, we all knew he was corrupt politician and that the laptop was real, we all were pretty sure he would be a terrible president (though we had hoped he wouldn't be and many of us prayed for him). But we lived our lives.

And if you cry ""J6! You all were so butthurt that you led an insurrection!"" well you tried to assassinate our guy and were perfectly okay with it, you rioted all over the country when our guy was first inaugurated. You ignored all the truths that came out after the fact but kept pushing the lie. Like, for instance, J6 itself. J6 was bullshit, the feds were involved in stoking the problem, and Pelosi admits she didn't do what she should have. She didn't take the troops she should have (and that Trump offered) to protect the Capitol that day. It was Pelosi's fault and yet the media lied to you and tried to make it some right wing conspiracy... which was likely the whole point.

But I digress. We are focused on you right now because the world revolves around you.

Grow up. If you want this country to be better, start with yourself and your pathetic behavior. 

That goes for today and any day after today. Choose to be better."

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007.¬†

  
The remarks came during a¬†press conference¬†introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home.¬†

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately¬†signed into law a few months later¬†by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns ‚Äì even legally ‚Äì in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"I don't want anyone to bash on me, so only comment if you're not here to call me stupid. I grew up a Rush Baby so my parents were strictly conservative and dismissed anything that wasn't. So as you can imagine I was the same way. Then I started growing up and seeing both sides of the story instead of just seeing democrats as ""tree-loving, hippie, potheads"". So I started questioning my politics and after hearing some level headed democrats instead of dismissing them as mini Al Gores, I started to see everything clearer. I still agree with the republican policies (POLICIES-not candidates, POLICIES) like the pro life, small government, etc. The only thing I don't agree with is their stand on gay marriage. I've been seeing some of the republican candidates lately and they really scare me. I feel like they're all wishy-washy, spineless, and it pisses me off when I see them changing their politics just to be more politically correct and ""please"" a wider variety of people. Take Michelle Bachmann for example. In an interview a few years earlier when she wasn't in the run for the presidency, she was super radical with her views on abortion (""No. No. No.""). And I admired that she was so stuck in her ways! It was nice-no, refreshing- to see someone in Washington take such a tough, for lack of a better word, stance on the issue. But now in an earlier interview she puts off as more lenient and almost forgiving on her stance (""Well, I mean in certain cases I GUESS abortion is OKAY...""). Seriously?! Sorry it's so long, I just want to see if anyone out there can help me restore my faith in the GOP (and Rush Limbaugh). "
This was my post yall can check out if you want many of them see something against their ideals and instantly hate and call you nazis and stuff like that. Can‚Äôt people accept not everyone agrees?

You can no longer hear opposing viewpoints on /r/politics because too many people use the arrows as ""I agree"" and ""I disagree"".   Over there the most generic leftist talking points are massively upvoted while anything that goes against the leftist hivemind is aggressively downvoted until it is buried.  Then the poster has negative karma on the sub and has to wait 10 minutes between comments.  They finally leave the subreddit, ensuring the liberal purity of /r/politics.  And that's why you have to come here to find different opinions.

The problem is you're bringing that same behavior with you.  When you abuse the arrows by upvoting leftist comments and downvoting mainstream Republican comments then you're only going to recreate a smaller version of /r/politics.  You're burying the very differing viewpoints you were seeking.

Therefore, until the top comments in every thread are mainstream Republican comments we will continue to ban anyone pushing a leftist narrative.  

Are you a Republican who has liberal viewpoints on one or two issues?  I suggest you focus on the other issues for the time being.

"Liberal here. I‚Äôm looking for a civil and respectful discussion without the insults and name calling.

There‚Äôs been many instances where I‚Äôve seen people, presumably conservative/MAGA/republican, comment on posts that Biden has screwed up the country or how badly he has done. However, they never elaborate on what they think was so bad. 

From my perspective I think he did a good job overall. As with every president I‚Äôd say he handled some things were very well and some were very disappointing, but overall he was good. Just real quickly the very good things, in my opinion, were his economic recovery after COVID, curbing inflation, handling Ukraine, infvesting in infrastructure, and green initiatives. Very bad was the Afghanistan exit strategy and an overly aggressive strategy to move towards electric vehicles. 

I find Israel and Gaza/Hamas very complicated and I honestly can‚Äôt speak with confidence about either side, but I do feel Israel had/has the right to defend themselves. Meanwhile a lot of innocent Palestinian civilians and children suffered needlessly.

So what did Biden do that was so horrible?"
"**TL; DR**: I'm certain these musicians and journalists are being dishonest (or ignorant) when they are saying Trump did not have permission to use their songs. Below is a bit about how the industry works and the reasons why, but the easiest way to think about it is like this: Does Dua Lipa know you signed up for Spotify? No. She agreed to let Spotify stream her music to you when you signed up so long as Spotify pays her based on the rate she agreed to with Spotify. Dua Lipa gave permission to stream her music to anyone who signed up for Spotify. It is the same model for political rallies. Foo Fighters gave authority to a licensing group like ASCAP to license their music for them. If you went through ASCAP (which Foo fighters is on) and you got a license, Foo Fighters already gave their permission to use their songs. You don't need to get individual permission if you get a blanket license.

**Alright folks, here's the detailed version:**

Music is frequently used illegally, so it is technically possible Trump didn't have permission to use various songs, but it is so unlikely that a major campaign would have not gone through the proper channels when using copyrighted material like a Foo Fighters song, because getting sued, losing money, and being tied up in court hurts the campaign. It's easier just to go through the legal channels.

Why? The music business is complicated.

The Foo Fighters (and any musician) can have many many revenue streams.

**Direct Sales** (Or mostly direct) - These are concerts, merchandise, and direct physical copies of their music (cds, records, cassettes, etc.). We buy a ticket and Foo Fighters get the money. Or really we buy a ticket from Ticket Master or a venue, the venue takes a cut and gives the rest to Foo Fighters. 

**Indirect Sales - Licensing** - *Music Licensing* is just the legal permission given from the artist to whomever wants to play the song for whatever reason. This is *incredibly complicated*, there are so many indirect ways Foo Fighters license their songs, but it is important to know that these ""non-for-profit"" groups [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/music-users), BMI, and SESAC basically track it all. If you are buying a license to play music almost anywhere, it is through these groups. If you are a musician, even a small one, and you are on Spotify, one of these groups is helping you track your sales.

Foo Fighters is on ASCAP.

Think playing music at a bar is simple? No. Representatives from ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC will absolutely find you (especially these days, it was harder for them to find you before the internet) and they will ask about music in your bar to make sure artists are getting what they are owed. 

**Indirect Sales - Blanket Licensing**

When these groups contact your bar, they will offer you a **blanket license** (probably not the technical term). If you sign up with ASCAP, it's kind of like signing up with Spotify. You have access to play any of the songs that ASCAP has in their repertory. If you have an agreement with ASCAP, then you can play Foo Fighters at your bar.

Alright, want karaoke at your bar? If a drunk guy wants to sing My Hero, well you better have a license so Foo Fighters get their cut through ASCAP (today, most Karaoke system bars use include licensing agreements already).

Want a live band? If they cover a Foo Fighters song, ASCAP will want to know and will start a legal suit against you for stealing Foo Fighters' music.

""Screw it, I'll just play the radio!"" - Nope, you need a license for that, too.

This is not unfair. If you own a song, you should have control where it is played and be paid appropriately. You can't use my song at a bar without paying me. That said, the system in place is pretty screwy.

It's also not has difficult as it sounds, but you do need to be careful. Bars have to think about music licensing (as well as sports licensing, tv licensing, radio, etc.) and build that into their business model. Maybe all they want is a Musak subscription, that includes all appropriate licensing already.

But this is true in doctors offices (technically if they play the radio in the waiting room, they are probably breaking the law), malls, concert venues (the music they play between acts), sports events, etc. 

**A key point here though is Foo Fighters have no idea WHO pays for these licenses and agree to the license whenever someone signs up through ASCAP**...I mean they could know if they wanted, it's all tracked, but Foo Fighters is really letting ASCAP do all that for them. Then the sales are all numbered, and royalties are usually distributed first to the Foo Fighters' label if they have one (the label gets a cut), and then to The Foo Fighters themselves.

So really, you might sign with ASCAP at your bar, you have access to play anything they represent and a portion of your recurring fee goes to all the artists whose songs you played at your bar.

*It should be noted that if Foo Fighters really hated some individual bar, they could legally go to ASCAP and say ""If you give this bar a license, we don't want our music played there"" and ASCAP will take you off their list for that individual bar the next time the bar has to pay for the license with ASCAP.*

**Indirect Sales - Individual Licenses**

If you want a Foo Fighters' song in your movie, you need a license. These deals can be more specific to the project. But still, they are tracked by ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC.

So if James Gunn wants a Foo Fighters song in his next Marvel Movie. This will be a much bigger deal than the blanket licenses, so Gunn will also need to get in contact with The Foo Fighters' label if they have one, and Dave Grohl will almost certainly be involved in the discussion. But Gunn gets all the contact information about it through ASCAP.

Gunn, the record label, and Foo Fighters will discuss a one time fee that James Gunn needs to pay for a license to the song as well as agree to a royalties rate. So Foo Fighters will get paid some percentage every time James Gunn's movie is also played with that song in it.

With a group as big as Foo Fighters, it is almost certain that Dave Grohl would be involved in that deal and given permission directly. Though that may not quite be the case. Sometimes record labels have control over movie use... but not when you're Dave Grohl.

So you have a one time deal AND royalties for every time the song is played with that content. This happens with movies, TV shows, radio shows, commercials, etc.

**Okay, What About Political Rallies?**

So with Blanket Licensing, Dave Grohl would have agree and give permission for you to use his music automatically when you sign up for the license with your bar, at your store, on your radio station, through Musak, etc. 

With Individual Licensing, Dave Grohl would have almost certainly given permission directly before signing the agreement.

If you have a major event at a venue and you plan to play music, you need a license. Even if your event isn't a profit making venture like a sports event, a comedy show, or whatever else, you need a license. **This would be a blanket license**.

A political rally is a major event that requires licenses for music (not to mention images, videos, etc).

It is incredibly unlikely that any major campaign would be oblivious to this.

It is so known that BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC all have information you can get if you want to use the music they license at your political events.

[Here is BMI's page on it](https://www.bmi.com/licensing/entry/political). They don't give much detailed info there, but the point is that you can get specific licenses for political events. [Here is ASCAP's information on it](https://www.bmi.com/licensing/entry/political). It is very long and even this is complicated.

In theory, a political campaign could easily get the wrong license for a political event and thus not have permission to play a song. They would have to rectify that.

However, the charge Dave Grohl is making is that HE did not give permission to the Trump campaign.

These event licenses are blanket licenses and are very likely included in the deals artists sign with ASCAP long long before they think any of their music will be played at a political rally.

**Any ASCAP artist could choose not to allow any campaign to play their music, but you would likely have to tell ASCAP ahead of time**

I doubt that these artists have that foresight. The smarter thing to do would be to tell ASCAP you don't want any political campaigns to use your music, and then if you want to let Harris use your music but not Trump, then you grant permission to Harris.

**Is it possible that Trump didn't bother getting a license?** Yeah, but that would be so profoundly stupid and costly that it is incredibly unlikely.

**Is it possible that Dave Grohl, Celine Dion, or any of these other artists actually refused permission in any legal way before Trump used their songs?** It's possible, but it is unlikely that Celine Dion or Dave Grohl saw Trump climbing in the polls in 2015 and thought to call their agents to tell ASCAP to not allow the Trump campaign to use their songs on a blanket licensing deal.

**It is far more likely that Dave Grohl didn't read all the ways ASCAP licenses his music, Trump's campaign licensed his music (which means Grohl gave permission whether he knew specifically or not), used his music at the rally and then Grohl was pissed and told X.com that he never gave permission, even though technically he did.**"
"I'm sorry, but my vote is not an economic one. I am of the opinion, as I'm sure many people are, that the economics of the U.S. are barely, if at all, controlled by the president. There is too much intervention by too much money from outside of the government making decisions for us. This in and of itself is certainly a huge problem, but it's pretty obvious to me that a change in president will not remotely solve the issue. 

To me, the larger issues are issues of civil liberties. And just as the issue of black slaves, women's right to vote, etc. (not to belittle other great progresses made by many other groups), changed this country for the better, a woman's right to choose and gay marriage are next on the list of great things we can accomplish.

And as usual, we are far behind the other progressive countries of the world (I wouldn't even honestly call the U.S. progressive at this point).

Tell me why I'm wrong. I want to open this for debate! I'm not trying to stifle anyone's opinion, although I do want to stir the pot. So let's chat!  "
"So uhhh I‚Äôve seen this post about 6 times on other stories of friends I follow and it‚Äôs kind of getting annoying and honestly pointless. Ppl saying what are illegals supposed to do when their country is a dictatorship and now they‚Äôre gonna get sent back. Like, holy moly. Are they stupid? Didn‚Äôt they see the fent crisis and sexual assaults made by migrants."

"The Covid vaccine was ALWAYS going to come from the U.S. I said this repeatedly early on and of course some pooh-poohed me for being jingoistic. Nah. Just common sense, which has fled portions of our country.

No single-payer, socialized medicine country was ever going to develop it ‚Äî at least in useful time ‚Äî because their very system kills risk-reward innovation driven by a free-market, capitalistic principles, and sucks off our system for advances.

So yes, once again, the United States, via free people in free companies operating in a (partially) free market rescues the world, this time from the Communist Chinese spawned and spread virus.

Not backing off any of these points because they are true and eyes need to be open."
"And if you were effected by the storm, would you be ok if it was Obama telling you that it wasn't his problem and that the states, and by proxy, you, have to now pay for the damages AND the disaster relief? "
"The 'Outnumbered' panel discussed their reaction to VP Kamala Harris' radical positions on key issues, exposed from a 2019 ACLU survey. #FoxNews"
"He is neurodivergent, autistic, and has ticks, plus he was so happy it makes me smile. It looked like to me he was giving his heart to America plus there are so many politicians who do that way including Obama, Harris, Clinton, etc. 

As I was watch Trump sign executive orders I saw a pbs article saying Elon doing racist salute, sure it‚Äôs seem but he didn‚Äôt click his heels or straightened his arms to his sides. 

I think these fake news, panicking left wing new stations are trying to find the tiniest thing to point at and twist the narrative about how ‚ÄúEvil republican regime taking over America.‚Äù

I am happy Trump can finally ignore them and focus on making America great again."
"This debate is much like last, a mockery of the American people with how biased the woman leading the debates is. Harris has avoided answering the question about packing the courts and the rest of her answers have just been trash."
Apparently In Joe's last few hours he pardoned Liz cheyney fauchi and Mark millie among a bunch of others on the j6 committee and with covid. Why would Pardons be necessary? I think there's about to be a rabbit hole here that's going to expose some really bad stuff in our government. This is somethibg the media would have ignored in his last term. Thankfully the media is going away. We need to know the truth about this stuff.

"With everything going on, I feel its important to talk about this. In 2008, President Obama won the Popular Vote with  69,456,897 . Current look on Fox news tells me President Trumps current total is  69,588,011. I'm not knocking on President Obama for what he was able to accomplish that night in 2008, but as of now, President Trump has passed him and I think its worth mentioning. Regardless of how this goes, I feel as if in some small way, this points  to an increase in Republican voting strength."
"This quote is very relevant today as half the people in our nation love the fact that they are owned by the government through the entitlements they receive and the permission they must acquire to practice even basic liberties.

When ObamaCare is put into place now the government will have a stake in your health as it directly costs them money. This will inevitably lead to regulations on what we can eat and do with regards to our own bodies.

With the shekels come the shackles..."
Why does it seem like all liberals are just useful idiots? How can you legitimately be that out of touch with reality.  It literally baffles me that these people have the audacity to act like they are superior.  I‚Äôm beginning to think being a liberal is an actual mental illness.   
"The ""anybody but Romney"" folks need to end their negative agenda because they aren't making life easier for the GOP as a whole.  These ABR people have supported Bachmann, Cain, Gingrich and now Santorum in little over 6 months.  If you have actively supported all of these during that time frame, you need to get out of politics altogether.  Of all the remaining candidates, Romney is most likely going to garner independent and moderate voters.  Whereas Santorum will have difficulty even getting moderate republican votes. "
"I am so happy to have the Biden/Harris administration finally gone.  For me, it has been an embarrassing 4 years.  Biden is a shell of himself and Harris should not been there in the first place.  I know people say Trump is this that and the other, but he is far more respected in the world.  "
I don't understand why democrats don't want to bring back America Greatness?  I always want to know even if they hate Trump why would they have issue with the idea of wanting to Make America Great Again.  Liberals must really hate America if they don't want to see America be Great Again.
"The election results are a real opportunity to see who knows what they are talking about and who is full of it. Decisive world events have a way of revealing the spin machines. For example, do you remember the ""Middle East Expert"" talking heads on CNN who were consistently wrong about the supposedly iron-fisted grip of pre-Arab Spring leaders?

I am tired of the hipster 'moderate Republican' line that it is a toss-up favoring Obama. Why is it considered smart to equivocate and be a contrarian against the obvious facts? I read news from Drudge and if the polls were adjusted to show reasonable republican turnout levels (not Obama-2008 democrat vs republican turnout levels) we would be leading those polls in many important swing states. Romney will also win the popular vote. There are countless sources aggregated on Drudge that analyze this.

Put me down as an informed person who is confident in their knowledge an will admit to their bias if proven wrong and/or expect others to do the same.

Maybe we can get a twin of this thread in r/politics later to let some liberals get their thoughts pinned down in writing."
"I am stunned and disgusted that this administration has repeatedly condemned an instance of free speech in order to appease and quell extremist rioters. Our ambassador, Susan Rice, would not even broach the issue of free speech on the Sunday shows; it was simply decided at the highest levels that somehow the US was being consistent and wise to join angry Muslims in their displeasure at this video.

If this is acceptable to Americans, we have effectively surrendered free speech. We can offend eachother freely, but not the scary Islamists. Thank you, President Obama, for making the first amendment officially meaningless."
"In recent months much has been discussed about gun control laws. I see, and respect, both sides of many of these issues, including concealed handguns and the constitutional right to own firearms. Yet one thing that I cannot rationalize is the staunch defense of personal ownership of automatic weapons such as the XM-15 used in the Newtown, CT shootings.

My question is, why? Why should it be an unassailable right for citizens to bear weaponry designed to give overwhelming fire superiority in a firefight? Is it simply the fear of at some point potentially needing to overthrow a tyrannical government? Or, is there a more complicated and rational reason behind this position?

Disclaimer: I am a democrat and was raised in a liberal household."
"It is my wish that they would have the respect of a guest at our subreddit.  They aren't entitled to be here, the only reason they aren't banned is due to a generous moderation policy.  Too many of them, it seems, feel like they are entitled to come in to our subreddit and shit all over the carpet because they feel like it.

Okay, I have a second wish.  I wish that they would not expect us Republicans to be *on call* for them whenever they have some question about what ""Republicans"" believe (as if we were all a monolithic bloc anyway).

Okay, a third wish.  Don't expect this subreddit to be some academic, university colloquium full of peer reviewed studies and esoteric intellectual and logical debates.  Sure we post arguments and news, but we also post memes and Obama jokes here and there is nothing wrong with that.  Heaven forfend that we should like to have a little bit of fun."

"My biggest problem with voting for Romney is his stern belief in his religion. I'm not religious, and I personally don't think a position of power should be held by someone so devoted to a faith. Could you please convince me to vote for Romney? I'm leaning more toward Gary Johnson at this point."
