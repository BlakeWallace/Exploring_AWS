      "with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\n",
      "manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\n",
      "what you think.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISCLAIMER\n",
      "----------\n",
      "Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\n",

      "to a real lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "1)  What is RIPEM?\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n",
      " the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n",
      " electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n",
      " sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n",
      " the intended recipient.)\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n",
      " Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n",
      " which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n",
      " considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n",
      " to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n",
      " Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n",
      " file:\n",
      "\n",
      " #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n",
      " #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n",
      " #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n",
      "\n",
      " Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n",
      " included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n",
      " RIPEM.\n",
      "\n",
      " The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n",
      " reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n",
      " humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n",
      " friend.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n",
      " in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n",
      " info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n",
      " does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n",
      " rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n",
      " U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n",
      " how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n",
      " GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n",
      " available here in addition to the full source tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n",
      "\n",
      " Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n",
      " Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n",
      " Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n",
      " Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n",
      " are expected, and help of users is invited.\n",
      "\n",
      "4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n",
      "\n",
      " Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n",
      " on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n",
      " guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n",
      " with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n",
      " Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n",
      " Emacs.\n",
      "\n",
      " If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n",
      " in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n",
      " and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n",
      "\n",
      "5)  What is RSA?\n",
      "\n",
      " RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n",
      " that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n",
      " decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n",
      " you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n",
      " decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n",
      " key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n",
      " decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n",
      " the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n",
      "\n",
      " Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n",
      " the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n",
      " MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n",
      " use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n",
      " must have come from the sender.\n",
      "\n",
      " RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n",
      " invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n",
      " pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "6)  What is DES?\n",
      "\n",
      " DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n",
      " secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n",
      " encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n",
      " your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n",
      " recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n",
      " allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n",
      "\n",
      " DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n",
      " key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n",
      " should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n",
      " corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n",
      " RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n",
      " multiple encryption with DES.\n",
      "\n",
      "7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n",
      "\n",
      " PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n",
      " encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n",
      " documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n",
      " specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n",
      " handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n",
      "\n",
      " For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n",
      " your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n",
      " received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n",
      " that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n",
      " his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n",
      " the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n",
      " described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n",
      " None of them provide perfect security.\n",
      "\n",
      "9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n",
      " characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n",
      " your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n",
      " This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n",
      " same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n",
      " same length, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n",
      " It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n",
      " of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n",
      " possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n",
      " different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n",
      " instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n",
      " only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n",
      " used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n",
      " passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n",
      " RFC 1321.\n",
      "\n",
      "11)  What is PGP?\n",
      "\n",
      " PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n",
      " PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n",
      " PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n",
      "\n",
      " Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n",
      "\n",

      "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "1)  What is RIPEM?\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy\n",
      " Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\n",
      " four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\n",
      " (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\n",
      " non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n",
      " Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n",
      " which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      " The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\n",
      " Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n",
      " considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n",
      " to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\n",
      " Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\n",
      " (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\n",
      " shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\n",
      " weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\n",
      " change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\n",
      " README file that this law not be violated:\n",
      "\n",
      " #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n",
      " #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n",
      " #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n",
      "\n",
      " Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n",
      " included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n",
      " RIPEM.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\n",
      " residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\n",
      " file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\n",
      " product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\n",
      " distribute it.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n",
      " ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n",
      " U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n",
      " how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n",
      " GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n",
      " available here in addition to the full source tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n",
      "\n",
      " Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n",
      " Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n",
      " Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n",
      " Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n",
      " are expected, and help of users is invited.\n",
      "\n",
      "4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n",
      "\n",
      " Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n",
      " on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n",
      " guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n",
      " with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n",
      " Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n",
      " Emacs.\n",
      "\n",
      " If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n",
      " in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n",
      " and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n",
      "\n",
      "5)  What is RSA?\n",
      "\n",
      " RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n",
      " that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n",
      " decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n",
      " you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\n",
      " decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n",
      " key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n",
      " decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n",
      " the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")\n",
      "\n",
      " Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\n",
      " originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\n",
      " origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\n",
      " (See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the\n",
      " sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\n",
      " authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm\n",
      " that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\n",
      "\n",
      " RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n",
      " invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\n",
      " in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\n",
      " also may be in sci.crypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "6)  What is DES?\n",
      "\n",
      " DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n",
      " secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n",
      " encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n",
      " your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n",
      " recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n",
      " allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n",
      "\n",
      " DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n",
      " key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n",
      " should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n",
      " corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\n",
      " standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\n",
      " near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\n",
      " stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\n",
      " interoperability.\n",
      "\n",
      "7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n",
      " It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n",
      " of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n",
      " possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n",
      " different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n",
      " instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n",
      " only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\n",
      " RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\n",
      " parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\n",
      " channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n",
      " used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n",
      " passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n",
      "\n",
      " MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n",
      " RFC 1321.\n",
      "\n",
      " There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\n",
      " a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\n",
      " function will be used if this is accepted as true.\n",
      "\n",
      "8)  What is PEM?\n",
      "\n",
      " PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\n",
      " encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\n",
      " working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n",
      " documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n",
      " specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n",
      " handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n",
      "\n",
      " For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n",
      " your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n",
      " received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n",
      " that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n",
      " his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n",
      " the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n",
      " described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n",
      " None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\n",
      " key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\n",
      " is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\n",
      "\n",
      " This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\n",
      " the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\n",
      " 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\n",
      " met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\n",
      " addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\n",
      " cryptography.\n",
      "\n",
      " This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\n",
      " everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\n",
      " patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\n",
      " cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\n",
      " (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\n",
      " and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\n",
      " compressed with a patented algorithm.)\n",
      "\n",
      "11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\n",
      "\n",
      " RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\n",
      " specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\n",
      " firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\n",
      " patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\n",
      "\n",
      "      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\n",
      "      (\"Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770\n",

      "\n",
      " PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\n",
      " cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\n",
      " example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\n",
      " PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\n",
      " companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\n",
      " products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\n",
      " patents.\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\n",
      " its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\n",
      " author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\n",
      " However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\n",
      " interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\n",
      " people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\n",
      " code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\"\n",
      " award.\n",
      "\n",
      "12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n",
      "\n",
      " RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\n",
      " Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\n",
      " key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\n",
      " those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys\n",
      " are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\n",
      " generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "13)  What is PGP?\n",
      "\n",
      " PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n",
      " PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n",
      " PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n",
      "\n",
      " A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n",
      "\n",
      " - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n",
      "   a direct network connection.\n",
      "\n",
      " - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\n",
      "   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\n",
      "   compatible with anything other than itself.\n",
      "\n",
      " - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\n",
      "   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\n",
      "   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\n",
      "   patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\n",
      "   either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\")\n",
      "   (See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\n",
      "   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\n",
      "   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\n",
      "   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\n",
      "   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:\n",

      "  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\n",
      "  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\n",
      "  an attacker to claim to be you.\n",
      "\n",
      "  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\n",

      "KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\n",

      "\n",
      "  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n",

      "  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n",
      "  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n",

      "  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n",
      "  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n",
      "  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n",

      "<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n",
      "\n",
      "  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n",
      "  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n",
      "  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n",
      "  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n",
      "  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n",
      "  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n",
      "  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n",
      "  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n",
      "  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n",
      "  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n",
      "  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n",
      "  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n",
      "  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n",
      "  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n",
      "  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n",
      "  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n",
      "  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n",
      "  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n",
      "  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n",
      "  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n",
      "  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n",
      "  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n",
      "  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n",
      "  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n",
      "  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n",
      "  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n",
      "  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n",

      "  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n",
      "  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n",
      "  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n",

      "  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n",
      "  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n",
      "  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n",
      "  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n",

      "  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n",

      "  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\n",
      "  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n",
      "  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\n",
      "  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n",
      "  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\n",
      "  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\n",
      "  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\n",
      "  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\n",
      "  servers like there's no tomorrow.''\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in\n",
      "  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\n",
      "  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n",
      "  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n",
      "  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,\n",
      "  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n",
      "  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n",
      "  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n",
      "  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n",
      "  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n",
      "  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n",
      "  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\n",
      "  against it. \n",
      "\n",
      "  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n",
      "  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n",
      "  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n",
      "  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\n",
      "  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\n",
      "  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\n",

      "  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\n",

      "\n",
      "For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\n",
      "private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\n",
      "tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\n",
      "protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\n",
      "the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\n",
      "law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\n",
      "industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\n",
      "protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\n",
      "protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\n",
      "technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\n",
      "unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\n",
      "by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\n",
      "been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\n",
      "new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\n",
      "relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\n",
      "an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\n",
      "using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\n",
      "commercial use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\n",

      "intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n",
      "\n",
      "A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n",

      "\n",
      "To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\n",

      "\n",
      "A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n",

      "     conversations of Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n",

      "     decipher the message?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n",
      "     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n",
      "     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n",

      "\n",
      "Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n",
      "     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n",
      "     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n",

      "A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n",
      "     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n",
      "     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n",

      "\n",
      "Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n",
      "     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n",
      "     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n",

      "\n",
      "Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:   The government designed and developed the key access\n",
      "     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n",
      "     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n",
      "     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n",

      "\n",
      "Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n",
      "     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n",

      "Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n",

      "     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n",
      "     powerful encryption devices?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n",
      "     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n",
      "     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n",

      "     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n",
      "     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n",
      "     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n",

      "millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\n",

      "     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\n",

      "product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\n",
      "Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\n",
      "the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\n",
      "should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n",

      "Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\n",
      "Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\n",

      "public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\n",
      "open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n",

      "Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\n",
      "prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\n",

      "                           PROPOSAL\n",
      "\n",
      "       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \n",
      "on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \n",
      "millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \n",
      "comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \n",
      "such as export controls which have effectively denied most people \n",
      "easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \n",
      "posed by new technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \n",
      "already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \n",
      "any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \n",
      "Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \n",
      "equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \n",
      "by the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \n",
      "80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \n",
      "chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \n",
      "agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over \n",
      "law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \n",
      "encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \n",
      "available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \n",
      "communications products.\n",
      "\n",
      "       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n",
      "\n",
      "       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \n",
      "before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \n",
      "not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \n",
      "have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \n",
      "government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\n",
      "independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \n",
      "based on open standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \n",
      "Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \n",
      "classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \n",
      "and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \n",
      "standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n",
      "\n",
      "       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \n",
      "system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \n",
      "law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \n",
      "publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \n",
      "safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \n",
      "individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \n",
      "inquiries?  \n",
      "\n",
      "       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \n",
      "importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \n",
      "digital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \n",
      "ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \n",
      "the discussion even begins.\n",

      "ESCROW\n",
      "\n",
      "The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \n",
      "whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \n",
      "warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \n",
      "over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \n",
      "will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \n",
      "Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \n",
      "agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \n",

      "yet.\n",

      "using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n",
      "\n",
      "The Administration claims that there are no back door means by \n",
      "which the government or others could break the code without \n",
      "securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \n",
      "be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \n",

      "   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\n",

      "   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\n",

      "   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\n",
      "   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\n",
      "   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\n",

      "   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n",

      "  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\n",

      "  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\n",

      "  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\n",
      "  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\n",
      "  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\n",
      "  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What is an attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\n",
      "  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\n",
      "  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\n",
      "  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\n",
      "  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\n",
      "  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\n",
      "  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\n",
      "  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\n",
      "  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\n",
      "  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\n",
      "\n",
      "  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\n",
      "  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\n",
      "  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\n",
      "  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\n",
      "  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\n",
      "  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\n",
      "\n",
      "  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\n",
      "  n = 2, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\n",
      "  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\n",
      "  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\n",
      "  is strong!''\n",
      "\n",
      "  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\n",
      "  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\n",
      "  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\n",
      "  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\n",
      "  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\n",
      "  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\n",
      "  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\n",
      "  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\n",
      "  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\n",
      "  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\n",
      "  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\n",
      "  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\n",
      "  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\n",
      "  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\n",
      "  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\n",
      "  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\n",
      "  \n",
      "* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n",
      "\n",
      "  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\n",
      "  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\n",
      "  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\n",
      "  or) of K and P.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\n",
      "  handling of keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\n",
      "  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\n",

      "  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\n",

      "* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n",
      "\n",
      "  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\n",
      "  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\n",
      "  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\n",
      "  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,\n",
      "  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do\n",
      "  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a\n",
      "  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\n",
      "  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\n",
      "  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\n",
      "  the language as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\n",
      "  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\n",
      "  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.\n",
      "  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other\n",
      "  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood\n",
      "  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a\n",
      "  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with\n",
      "  reasonably robust answers.\n",
      "\n",

      "  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\n",

      "  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\n",
      "  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\n",
      "  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\n",
      "  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\n",
      "  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\n",
      "  addresses given)\n",
      "\n",
      "  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\n",
      "\n",
      "  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\n",
      "  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\n",
      "  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s\n",
      "  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\n",
      "  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\n",

      "  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\n",
      "  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\n",
      "  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\n",
      "  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\n",

      "  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\n",
      "  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\n",
      "  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\n",
      "  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\n",
      "  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\n",
      "  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\n",
      "  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\n",
      "  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\n",
      "  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\n",
      "  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\n",
      "  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\n",
      "  ciphertext into plaintext.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\n",
      "  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\n",
      "  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\n",
      "  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\n",
      "  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\n",
      "  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n",
      "\n",
      "  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\n",
      "  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\n",
      "  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\n",
      "  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\n",
      "  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\n",
      "  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\n",
      "  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\n",
      "  to the mid-60's.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\n",
      "  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\n",
      "  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\n",
      "  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\n",
      "  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\n",
      "  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\n",
      "  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\n",
      "  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\n",
      "  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\n",
      "  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\n",
      "\n",
      "  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\n",
      "  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\n",
      "  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\n",
      "  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\n",
      "  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\n",
      "  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\n",
      "  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\n",

      "\n",
      "  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\n",
      "  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\n",
      "  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\n",
      "  and you don't have to worry about spies.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\n",
      "  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\n",
      "  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\n",
      "  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "* What's RSA?\n",
      "\n",
      "  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\n",
      "  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\n",
      "  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\n",
      "  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\n",
      "  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\n",
      "  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\n",
      "  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\n",
      "  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\n",
      "  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Is RSA secure?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\n",
      "  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\n",
      "  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\n",
      "  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\n",
      "  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\n",

      "\n",
      "* How fast can people factor numbers?\n",
      "\n",
      "  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\n",
      "  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\n",
      "  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\n",
      "  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\n",
      "  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\n",
      "  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\n",
      "  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\n",
      "  any case.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\n",
      "  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\n",
      "  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\n",
      "  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\n",
      "  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\n",
      "  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\n",
      "  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\n",
      "  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\n",
      "  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\n",

      "  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\n",

      "  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\n",

      "  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n",
      "  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n",
      "  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n",
      "  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n",
      "  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n",

      "  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n",
      "  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n",
      "  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n",

      "\n",
      "A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\n",

      "system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\n",
      "little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\n",
      "first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\n",
      "representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\n",
      "introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\n",
      "payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\n",
      "systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\n",
      "both computation and communication complexity than any such system\n",
      "proposed previously.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\n",
      "Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\n",
      "mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\n",
      "make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\n",
      "ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\n",
      "Diffie-Hellman problem. \n",
      "  \n",
      "Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\n",
      "previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\n",
      "is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\n",
      "incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\n",
      "the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\n",
      "first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\n",
      "after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\n",
      "most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\n",
      "which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\n",
      "Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\n",
      "negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\n",
      "a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\n",
      "previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\n",

      "\n",
      "On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\n",
      "together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\n",
      "to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\n",
      "law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\n",
      "chip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\n",
      "escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\n",
      "both are needed to reconstruct a key.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHIP STRUCTURE\n",
      "\n",
      "The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\n",
      "algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\n",
      "with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\n",
      "for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n",
      "16 Mbits a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each chip includes the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n",
      "   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n",
      "   N, a 30-bit serial number\n",
      "   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n",
      "\n",
      "To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\n",
      "telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\n",
      "we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\n",
      "conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\n",
      "the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\n",
      "be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\n",
      "fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n",
      "\n",
      "   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n",
      "   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\n",
      "under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\n",
      "encrypted under the family key F.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n",
      "\n",
      "All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\n",
      "information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\n",
      "a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\n",
      "are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\n",
      "Mikotronx.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\n",
      "escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\n",
      "into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\n",

      "   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\n",

      "\n",
      "   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\n",
      "rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\n",
      "\n",
      " - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use\n",
      "   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\n",
      "\n",
      " - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone\n",
      "   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\n",
      "   This stuck them as strange, until now...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\n",
      "concerns over the new Clipper Chip:\n",
      "\n",
      "  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\n",
      "    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\n",
      "    of the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\n",
      "    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\n",
      "    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\n",
      "    changing the keys themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\n",
      "    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\n",
      "    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\n",
      "    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\n",
      "    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\n",
      "    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell\n",
      "me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.\n",
      "However he told me a little:\n",
      "\n",
      " - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\n",
      "   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\n",
      "   secure.\n",
      "\n",
      " - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\n",
      "   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\n",
      "   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\n",
      "   the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\n",
      "      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\n",
      "\n",
      "    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\n",
      "      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\n",
      "      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\n",
      "      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\n",
      "      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\n",
      "      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\n",
      "      hardware chip.\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\n",
      "      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\n",
      "      enough, which probably won't happen]).\n",
      "\n",
      "    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\n",
      "together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\n",
      "to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\n",
      "law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\n",
      "chip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\n",
      "escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\n",
      "both are needed to reconstruct a key.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHIP CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\n",
      "encryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\n",
      "(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\n",
      "(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\n",
      "operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\n",
      "Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each chip includes the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n",
      "   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n",
      "   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\n",
      "   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n",
      "\n",
      "The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\n",
      "\"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\n",
      "implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\n",
      "$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\n",
      "technology is shrunk to .8 micron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n",
      "\n",
      "To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\n",
      "telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\n",
      "we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\n",
      "conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\n",
      "with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\n",
      "without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\n",
      "be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\n",
      "encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\n",
      "telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\n",
      "values:\n",
      "\n",
      "   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n",
      "   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \n",
      "\n",
      "which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\n",
      "field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\n",
      "concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\n",
      "key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\n",
      "an authorized wiretap has been installed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the\n",
      "session key:\n",
      "\n",
      "   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n",
      "\n",
      "All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\n",
      "Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\n",
      "a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\n",
      "are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\n",
      "Mykotronx.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\n",
      "escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\n",
      "80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\n",
      "80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\n",
      "keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\n",
      "function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\n",
      "  \n",
      "To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\n",
      "first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\n",
      "S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n",
      "64-bit block R1:\n",
      "\n",
      "        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\n",
      "N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n",
      "\n",
      "        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n",
      "        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n",
      "\n",
      "R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\n",
      "first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\n",
      "rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\n",

      "\n",
      "                        by Robin Hanson\n",
      "                     Draft, April 21, 1993\n",
      "\n",
      "  SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,\n",
      "  wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the\n",
      "  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \n",
      "  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "\n",
      "Until now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \"wiretaps\",\n",
      "detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\n",
      "time, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\n",
      "aid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\n",
      "technologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\n",
      "private communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\n",
      "literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\n",
      "microphones at either end.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\n",
      "phone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\n",
      "that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \"wiretap\" chip\n",
      "to be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\n",
      "which have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\n",
      "announced it would use these chips \"in all its secure telephone\n",
      "products\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Each chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\n",
      "be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\n",
      "each conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\n",
      "info in a special \"law enforcement block\".  Law enforcement officers\n",
      "with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\n",
      "indentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\n",
      "on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\n",
      "security.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and\n",
      "many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\n",
      "has claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\n",
      "inspire confidence on this point [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\n",
      "whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\n",
      "investigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\n",
      "investigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\n",
      "give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\n",
      "Or to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\n",
      "each wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\n",
      "of forcing phones to support wiretaps?\n",
      "\n",
      "To start to answer this question, we might compare the current\n",
      "benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\n",
      "costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\n",
      "benefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\n",
      "\n",
      "WIRETAP BENEFITS\n",
      "\n",
      "1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\n",
      "[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\n",
      "requests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\n",
      "with the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\n",
      "resulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\n",
      "wiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\n",
      "76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\n",
      "regarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\n",
      "authorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\n",
      "calls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\n",
      "average of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\n",
      "reporting costs), mostly for labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\n",
      "about 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\n",
      "least four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\n",
      "gets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\n",
      "total 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\n",
      "year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\n",
      "expenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \"access\"\n",
      "lines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\n",
      "phone line, or about two cents a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\n",
      "of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\n",
      "expected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\n",
      "wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\n",
      "the same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\n",
      "wiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden\n",
      "microphones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\n",
      "might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\n",
      "we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\n",
      "on average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\n",
      "benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\n",
      "of two cents a month per phone line.\n",
      "\n",
      "WIRETAP COSTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\n",
      "encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\n",
      "have offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\n",
      "ears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\n",
      "domestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\n",
      "additional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\n",
      "increasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\n",
      "be used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\n",
      "these keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\n",
      "The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\n",
      "design is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\n",
      "process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\n",
      "(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\n",
      "lots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\n",
      "wiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\n",
      "replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\n",
      "be represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\n",
      "widely believed that governments are less efficient than private\n",
      "enterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\n",
      "perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\n",
      "standards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\n",
      "they pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\n",
      "U.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\n",
      "access line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\n",
      "month, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\n",
      "as much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\n",
      "And this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because\n",
      "their encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\n",
      "wouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\n",
      "per phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\n",
      "phone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\n",
      "slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\n",
      "When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\n",
      "attach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\n",
      "But when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\n",
      "clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\n",
      "would really be less than the benefits.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\n",
      "compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\n",
      "rate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\n",
      "nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\n",

      "      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\n",
      "      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\n",

It\\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\\nwhat you think.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER\\n----------\\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\\nother than one person\\'s opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\\nto a real lawyer.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\n---------------------\\n\\n1)  What is RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\\n the intended recipient.)\\n\\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n\\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\\n file:\\n\\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n\\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n RIPEM.\\n\\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\\n friend.\\n\\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\\n\\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n\\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n\\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n\\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n\\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n Emacs.\\n\\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\n5)  What is RSA?\\n\\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n\\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender\\'s private key.  The recipient can\\n use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\\n must have come from the sender.\\n\\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\\n\\n6)  What is DES?\\n\\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n\\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n\\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\\n multiple encryption with DES.\\n\\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\\n\\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n\\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n\\n8)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n\\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n\\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n None of them provide perfect security.\\n\\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n\\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people\\'s keys.\\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\\n same length, etc.\\n\\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n\\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n\\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n\\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n RFC 1321.\\n\\n11)  What is PGP?\\n\\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n\\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n\\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection.\\n\\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\\n   PGP 2.0.)\\n\\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP\\'s original\\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\\n\\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n   #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n   #contraband.  \\n\\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\\n   in Europe and other places.\\n\\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n\\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\\n shouldn\\'t be that way, and some people interpret various documents\\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n\\n12)  What about RPEM?\\n\\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\\n\\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n\\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n\\n13)  What is MIME?\\n\\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\\n the matter.\\n\\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\\n\\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and\\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is\\n probably key distribution.\\n'"

       "'So obviously as the title reads, I am a democrat and I\\'ve been reading the posts you guys put up here. With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it\\'s the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I\\'m not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I\\'m tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my \"enemy\". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit 1: I would like to say that the overwhelmingly large amount of positivity in the comments is great to see. Also, I know it\\'s not a lot of upvotes so far but it\\'s the most I\\'ve ever received on Reddit so thank you all so much.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future. '"
