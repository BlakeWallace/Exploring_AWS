Maybe so, but they were, after all, President.  In the corporate     world it's SOP for retiring senior executives to be given nice    pensions, etc.  The point is that they performed a service and    this is part of the compensation package.

       "\"Kriz  wrote      The most recent reason given by the Clinton Administration for     calling for federally funded abortions is that many private     health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion.         The following are two form letters regarding this.  Please send     them around to friends as well as other BBSs       Just sign it and send it, sonny, don't read the fine print. Just   sign it, sonny!    .      Cheers,   Kent            Well you know that you're getting somewhere, when you start getting  responses like this.    Kent, let me explain it to you.    If you are paying for a phone, and you don't want call waiting, YOU DON'T  NEED TO PAY FOR CALl WAITING.    This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL  nervous, because it has exposed a real scam.    If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT   abortion coverage  there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED  to pay for it.   Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction  coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage .  There are  basic services  and there are  optional services , Dennis. Call  waiting is an optional service, but having the number     work on one's phone is a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the     on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a     in it, doesn't mean  that he has the right to demand that the phone company  unbundle  the charges for the use of each phone digit  an unbundling that would be horrendously inefficient because of all the billing   bookkeeping overhead. Similarly,  abortion can be seen as a  basic service .  Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the  views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority,  an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that  way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities  with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro lifer did  the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which  would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you  would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro choicer I know would stop you carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...            Kevin\""

       "'  ABOUT THIS POSTING                    This is a  still rather rough  listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It  this FAQ, not RIPEM  was written and will be maintained by Marc variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis  follow up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER            Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one persons opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS                            What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail  PEM  using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication  i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed  and privacy  i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.    Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.      How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file     Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution   outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,   the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it  not to mention the  humans that run them.   Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com  cd to rsaref  and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its  home site  on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub crypt , and read the file  GETTING ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.      Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS DOS and most flavors of  Unix  SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.   Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX style port and a rather nice  Mac like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.      Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.      What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys  one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot  reasonably  be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.   Note that the  message  sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message.  See  What is DES?     Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message  See  What is a fingerprint, like  MD ?   is encrypted with the senders private key.  The recipient can  use the senders public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men  Rivest, Shamir and Adleman  who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub faq  or look in sci.crypt.      What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA  it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipients public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.      What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs            these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs          .   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.      Whats this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate  if a  bad guy  convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management  a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.      Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other peoples keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.       What is a fingerprint, like MD ?   MD  is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a     bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible  in a reasonable amount of computation  to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the senders private key,  only the MD  of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD  is sometimes used for other purposes  for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to     bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD  is described in its entirety  including an implementation in C  in  RFC     .       What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM      PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.     RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP  in fact, PGP  .  is not compatible with    PGP  . .      RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed  thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGPs original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation       In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,      you shouldnt actually run PGP on your computer, because Public     Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is     contraband.       Both PGP and RIPEM are export restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial  many people think it  shouldnt be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.   See    DISCLAIMER         What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public key cipher invented by Rabin  which is not RSA  in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many   including Rabin , Public Key Partners  PKP  claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.       What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC     .  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear  some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application x ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.       I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...   You may wish to check the companion post  ripem attacks  which  discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEMs security and  what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEMs main  weak area  is  probably key distribution. '"
